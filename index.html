                                This short film in VR is an spin-off project from Huldufugl and Hikapee's (equally ambitious) stage show, The Hidden People, after that project was delayed by a year due to the pandemic.
                                <br /><br />
                                We've been collaborating with UK aerial circus company Hikapee since 2018 on a large-scale stage production - but when it became apparent that we were going to have to pause work on it for at least a year, we came up with the idea of producing an animated VR short film using the same performers, set in the same world, but with a brand new storyline.
                                <br /><br />
                                The first step was to find a motion capture company brave enough to work with tumbling, spinning circus performers using silks, trapeze and counterbalancing equipment - a real challenge for the tracking system - and then do the entire thing on location, whilst adhering to strict COVID-19 safety measures.
                                <br /><br />
                                We were extremely lucky to find a partner in Target3D, who sent an incredible crew to join our artists in isolation at 101 Outdoor Arts in Newbury for a week. Under Bryony from Hikapee's direction, they recorded an entire narrative of aerial circus-infused action.
                                <br /><br />
                                
                            </div>
                            <div class="bodyTextCol six columns">
                                The film is currently under production with all the virtual sets, characters, lighting and composition currently under way.
                                <br /><br />
                                It's a unique challenge to produce animated work for VR - where almost anything is possible in terms of angles, lighting, sound and set design. For our piece, we're taking a lot of cues from theatre over film in terms of set layout and the audience's relationship to the performers - but this still leaves us a huge possibility space to play with, which is extremely exciting!
                                <br /><br />
                                We're also aiming for a unique art style that represents the Icelandic nature - acheived through procedural modelling in Houdini, taking the rough outlines of landscapes, and 'shredding' them into thousands of small, individually coloured polygons. This approach retains sharp edges in VR even up-close, without using textures, whilst also giving us fine control over colour, pre-baked static lighting, and vertex shader effects like wind movement in trees, water and moss.
                                <br /><br />
                                Release is scheduled for early 2022, for Oculus Quest and other major VR platforms.

                                In 2017, my studio Horizons (along with co-founder Yuli Levtov and David Li) were approached by Chris Milk and Aaron Koblin's VR powerhouse Within to help them develop an incredibly ambitious VR project in collaboration with Oculus Studios, and the musical / creative force of OKGO.
                                <br /><br />
                                The task was to create an experience in VR where the user could produce their very own pop song, complete with drums, bass, guitar, synth, vocals (recorded and auto-tuned by the user!) and a special cow-based freestyle solo instrument.
                                <br /><br />
                                The final piece includes a staggering amount of layers of animation, machine learning, audio analysis and processing, a custom sound engine, hand interaction and musical theory.
                                <br /><br />

                                In 2018 we were very excited to give the world a peek of the final piece, at both Tribeca Film Festival and Sonar+ in Barcelona.
                                <br /><br />
                                Two audience members at a time, carefully guided by white-coated docents, could collaborate on building a song together in a purpose-built booth. The piece attracted a significant amount of positive attention, being described as 'Social VR's Rock Band' by Wired, and others.
                                <br /><br />
                                My role as lead developer ranged from prototyping musical interaction concepts at the start of the project, to co-ordinating the fantastic development team across several different cities and time zones, overseeing the asset pipeline of animated creatures from the art team into Unity, and working directly on various parts of the project.
                                <br /><br />
                                We're excited for the final public release of the project, to see the music people make in the Menagerie of the Holy Cow!

                                Out Of Sync is a mad idea, an experimental performance formed in response to the
                                COVID-19 pandemic. So obviously in 2020 many artists across the world are unable to
                                perform to audiences of more than a handful of people (at best), and those countries
                                where audiences <em>can</em> gather in numbers have achieved this largely through
                                (sensibly) strict border restrictions, meaning they are unable to invite
                                international artists to come and play. In addition to this, the global climate
                                crisis remains &#8211; albeit backgrounded a bit by the pandemic. <br /><br />
                                The idea is that a performer in Iceland (at the time gatherings were limited to 10
                                people or fewer) would live-stream to a club in Taipei, Taiwan. There, a full
                                audience of dancing people (Taiwan had no gathering restrictions at the time) would
                                enjoy the party. However, we had two dancers, or &#8220;eyes&#8221; inside the club,
                                using mobile phones to provide a two-way video stream <em>back</em> to Reykjavik,
                                where two people at a time would experience the party on the other side of the world
                                inside large wooden booths specially built for the purpose.<br /><br />

                                Now a 90 minute performance, regardless of how great the music is or colourful his
                                onesie is, might not be the most visually interesting experience if it was
                                a simple camera setup. Luckily, I had been working for several months with my
                                long-suffering collaborator Yuli Levtov on an exciting new project called Volta,
                                which aims to make it easy for performing artists to create visually engaging
                                livestream experiences, either for 2d video streaming or in VR.<br /><br />
                                Even more luckily, the month before, we had integrated Keijiro Takahashi&#8217;s
                                outstanding Rcam2 system into Volta&#8217;s existing visual system, allowing us to
                                do a full AR performance using only an iPad Pro and a laptop running Unity + Touch
                                Designer.<br /><br />
                                We&#8217;re super happy with the results, which you can watch above, and excited to
                                see where this new medium can take us. Since then we&#8217;ve incorporated a
                                user-facing editor into the Volta product, which you can read more about below. In
                                addition, this same team has applied to produce several more events during 2021 to
                                investigate alternate means of performance and audience experience &#8211; both as
                                the world recovers from the pandemic, and as we look forwards to ways to reduce the
                                burden of extensive travel on artists wanting to perform outside of their home
                                countries, whilst still making it a party!<br /><br />

                                The concept initially began as a short play by Nanna, written and performed in a
                                conventional theatre in 2016 &#8211; after which I put forward the idea to re-create
                                this piece in VR. We premiered the first version in Reykjavík in August 2017, and
                                developed it for a longer run in July 2018, before taking the show to the Stockholm
                                Fringe Festival in September 2018, and with more international dates planned for
                                2019!<br /><br />
                                One person at a time experiences the piece inside of a 2 x 2m physical space, whilst
                                the actor performs in a separate physical space. For our first outing, we used the
                                Xsens motion capture suit (expertly handled by <a href="http://puppit.is"
                                    target="_blank">PuppIT</a>), but currently the show involves two Oculus Rift
                                setups, sharing the same virtual space using multiplayer networking.<br /><br />
                                Show control is handled by an operator, who can observe and control both events in
                                the world and the &#8216;voice in your head&#8217; via a Qlab interface, and we have
                                a beautiful LED box created by Swedish engineering magicians <a

                                Originally created for the Isle of Games 002 (see isleofgames.is) exhibition on the
                                theme of &#8220;The Tempest&#8221;, the player is making their way through a pitch
                                black world, with nothing but the wind to guide their path. <br /><br />
                                The installation version was for two people to cooperate, one using a joystick to
                                control the character, the other using rotating lava rock + button to control the
                                wind. This version is just controlled using the keyboard.<br /><br />

                                Unconfined is an immersive interactive installation by
                                Universal Everything and Zaha Hadid Architects commissioned by Samsung Mobile and
                                unveiled at Milan Design Week 2017, to accompany the launch of the new Galaxy S8
                                phone.
                                <br /><br />
                                So I&#8217;ve been a massive fanboy of Universal Everything&#8217;s work ever since
                                Matt Pyke formed the studio post-Designers Republic, so being invited to join them
                                as a developer on this adventure was a bit exciting, to say the least!<br /><br />
                                The brief was to produce a real-time, interactive artwork that would be projected
                                onto seven monumental &#8216;petals&#8217;, designed and inhabiting a space by Zaha
                                Hadid Architects, within a relatively short timeframe &#8211; and with a lot of
                                press attention on the final result, so no small order.<br /><br />

                                With a tight timeline, the lead developer Chris Mullany and I developed a system for
                                simulating choreographed bird-like motion onto thousands of unique
                                &#8216;avatars&#8217; &#8211; playful, generative striped characters who would fly
                                and dance around the space.<br /><br />
                                We worked rapidly in Unity, with Chris handling the creation and rendering of the
                                Avatars, and me handling the flocking motion and choreographies that would play in
                                synchronicity with composed music from Simon Pyke / Freefarm.<br /><br />
                                The final setup in Milan required an impressive assortment of hardware, handled by
                                an amazing crew of projectionists, d3 operators, sound and lighting designers, and
                                our playback rig &#8211; 6 high-end PCs running Unity apps, all synchronised via
                                network from a single server, from which we could adjust and refine all aspects of
                                the show once we arrived in Milan.<br /><br />

                                submit a proposal for a launch title for Google&#8217;s new VR headset, Daydream. I

                                Li and Leif Podhajsky, we laid out plans to create the first music-focused title for

                                For a few days in February 2016, visitors of Harpa Music Hall in Reykjavík were
                                invited to play the façade of the building as they would an instrument. A
                                &#8220;light organ&#8221; was placed on the 4th floor balcony, with a stunning view
                                of the inside of the geometrical glass front and the downtown
                                area.<br /><br />Anyone who passed through could learn how to play in blue or red or
                                green, with quick flashes or swelling pads of light, and impress the whole city with
                                an optical performance.

                                The Moon Seat is a playful installation that entertains our inner child whilst
                                simultaneously courting long forgotten childhood fears.
                                <br /><br />
                                The installation had its first public outing at the <strong>e-Luminate</strong>
                                festival in Cambridge, UK from 12th-17th February 2016, and was located on the front
                                lawn of the prestigious Cambridge Union Society.
                                <br /><br />
                                Audience members were invited to sit, at which point the pool of moonlight would
                                instantly open to show their shadow. After a few seconds, their shadow would
                                transform into an animal &#8211; still controlled by their bodily movements, but
                                with a character all of its own. An ethereal generative soundtrack reacting to the
                                users&#8217; movements accompanies the piece.

                                I&#8217;d worked with Alex for a long time at B-Reel, and I was very excited to be
                                asked to get involved in his first independent installation art piece!
                                <br /><br />
                                It quickly became apparent that we were going to need some more help, so we drafted
                                in ex-B-Reelers and good friends Yi-Wen Lin and Christian Persson to come on board.

                                mmorph is an adventure into new ways of delivering interactive music in the browser
                                and beyond.
                                <br /><br />
                                A collaboration between global music agency MassiveMusic, Reactify Music, Grotesk,
                                Enzien Audio and myself, mmorph is an example of a new workflow which we hope will
                                open up many possibilities for interactive audio &#8211; first in the browser, and
                                then for games, apps, installations and VR.<br /><br />
                                The site takes you through an interactive music piece, enabling different musical
                                parts, applying realtime effects, composing and looping a top-line synth, and
                                creating intense build-ups and drops!

                                My role was lead developer on the project, handling the integration of the audio
                                code from Reactify &#038; Enzien Audio (who in turn were working with original music
                                composed by Massive) with realtime SVG graphics and animations art-directed by
                                Grotesk.

                                The interactive audio was produced via a unique workflow where Reactify worked
                                rapidly and closely with Massive&#8217;s in-house composer in Pure Data, an visual
                                programming environment that allows for real-time prototyping and development.

                                This Pure Data &#8216;patch&#8217; was then converted to run in the browser via
                                Enzien Audio&#8217;s <strong>Heavy</strong> compiler. This compiler can also
                                transform the same source patch into code suitable for Unity, Unreal engine,
                                OpenFrameworks, desktop/mobile apps and VR experiences, with little or no
                                alterations to the original.

                                Get Vive Ready by HTC, Google and B-Reel is a WebGL experience that invites the user
                                to test if they are &#8216;Vive&nbsp;Ready&#8217;, to promote the launch of

                                The site uses a mobile device as a controller for the 3D desktop experience, and
                                requires you to chop, dodge, swing and shake your way through four challenging
                                levels.

                                Sónar is an international festival of progressive music and multimedia arts,
                                originally out of Barcelona, but now taking place in several locations worldwide,
                                including Reykjavik since 2013.<br /><br />
                                It is hosted in the landmark building Harpa, a beautiful structure with a unique
                                interlocking cell-like front facade (designed by Olafur Eliasson) each containing an
                                LED light fixture. Combined it forms a large outdoor screen that is visible across
                                much of downtown Reykjavik.

                                Artist Atli Bollasson and I were lucky enough to be the first outside artists to do
                                something on this facade in 2014, with the publicly-playable arcade game <a

                                After the success of PONG, Harpa and the Sónar organisers invited Atli and myself to
                                do a repeat installation on the lights of Harpa for the festival in 2015, and again
                                in 2016.

                                We knew we wanted to do a bit more than simply re-run PONG, so instead we decided
                                &#8211; in addition to running the game &#8211; we would turn the entire building
                                into an audio-reactive light show, taking the music being played inside and use it
                                to drive the visuals outside.
                                <br /><br />
                                To do this we reached out to other creative developers, providing them with a code
                                framework, brief, and challenge to do something amazing with only 36 x 11 pixels. We
                                ended up with over 12 functioning visual responses from 8 developers from around
                                Europe, which was way beyond our expectations.

                                <!-- The results can be seen in the video above, for three days the visuals were bouncing around to the likes of Skrillex, Todd Terje and Elliphant, and were attracting attention not only in the city of Reykjavik, but also (we happily realised) inside the venue as well, where we accidentally became the main lightshow for the SonarPub stage. -->

                                a robotic arm, in order to promote the new flavours of Pringles
                                Tortillas.<br /><br />
                                Users in the UK and Germany were able to sign up via Twitter and/or Facebook to take
                                a hit at the unlucky piñata, successful entrants would win a Tortillas-related
                                prize!

                                This required a lot of research into fabrication methods, and learning about
                                pneumatics for the first time, combined with electronic control (via <a
                                    href="http://www.phidgets.com/" target="_blank">Phidgets</a>) and backend

                                Isobar)<br /><br />
                                After constructing two beautiful robots (Pedro &#038; Mario, in reserve), we to work
                                smashing piñatas, the arm pounding each one with 20psi of force per hit. Over 40
                                piñatas a day were obliterated live online, in a custom-built Mexican marketplace

                                City of Drones is an interactive digital environment developed by musician John
                                Cale, speculative architect Liam Young and digital artists FIELD. Charting the story
                                of a lost drone drifting through an abstract cityscape, players are invited to pilot
                                a virtual craft and remotely explore this imaginary world. Samples from Cale’s
                                original soundscape compositions echo across the landscape as we see the city
                                through the eyes of the drone, buzzing between the buildings, drifting endlessly, in
                                an ambient audio visual choreography.<br /><br />
                                City of Drones lives online, and as an installation at the Barbican Center, London,
                                as part of the Digital Revolution exhibition.

                                I was brought on to the project to develop the dynamic audio of the piece with the
                                team at FIELD. This involved remixing original material from John Cale, including
                                bespoke work from BXFTYS, and setting it all in a constantly changing, immersive 3D
                                sonic landscape.
                                <br /><br />
                                Spot sound effects are triggered by different locations within the environment, and
                                the sounds of drones as they fly past are processed using the WebAudio HRTF panner
                                to accurately position the sounds in 3D space.
                                <br /><br />
                                The background music layer and ambience also change as you fly through the different
                                areas.
                                <br /><br />
                                In addition, I also contributed to the physics of the drones, giving them some
                                freedom of movement as they fly around the space, avoiding buildings and each other,
                                plus I developed the on-screen HUD graphics and animation.

                                Collaborating with lead engineer Laurence Symonds, FIELD and A&#038;P, I was
                                responsible for the design &#038; implementation of the motor software control
                                system, which played back a pre-choreographed sequence (pre-visualised and designed
                                in Houdini by FIELD).
                                <br /><br />I was also very happy to be part of the superhuman build, test &#038;
                                installation team.

                                Custom Arduino firmware and a unique serial protocol needed to be developed in order
                                to synchronise movement across all 48 motors for the duration of the hour-plus long
                                sequence. A Node.js server was written to handle playback and synchronisation with a
                                wall-mounted display, and triggering of audio samples via OSC.

                                Conceived and produced by Atli Bollason, the project began as a chance meeting
                                between myself and Atli at a birthday party in Reykjavik, and over the next few
                                months developed into a reality &#8211; with not only the CEO of the building coming
                                on board very quickly, but for the first time for a project like this, Ólafur
                                himself (the first time he has allowed a project like this to take over the
                                facade&#8217;s lighting system). Vodafone Iceland also agreed to sponsor the
                                project, and supply us with some of the equipment.
                                <br /><br />
                                The project was launched on Menningarnótt (Culture Night) on the 23rd August 2014,
                                and ran for a week afterwards as part of the Reykjavik Dance Festival. <br />
                                For the launch night, we setup a stage in front of the building, and players used a
                                pair of phones to control their &#8216;paddles&#8217; on the 43m-high screen.<br />
                                Afterwards, players were able to join a special Wi-fi network which took them
                                directly to the game, which was transmitted from a hill overlooking the building.
                                This would allow them to join a virtual queue, and play against friends or complete
                                strangers.

                                Our roles were split with Atli handling the concept, creative direction, project
                                management and publicity, and me handling the design, hardware, networking and
                                programming.
                                <br /><br />
                                Three separate Node.js servers run together to create the experience; one running in
                                the basement of Harpa which outputs DMX to control the 35&#215;11 pixel display (6
                                universes of 512 channels each), one running in the cloud which actually simulates
                                the game physics, and receives WebSocket connections from the player&#8217;s phone,
                                and another which handles the game queue.
                                <br /><br />
                                An HTML5 mobile front-end was also developed to give visual feedback to the player
                                of their paddle, and current score.

                                Resonate is a festival that brings together artists to drive a forward-looking
                                debate on the position of technology in art and culture.<br /><br />
                                Held annually in Belgrade, Serbia, it draws visual artists, programmers, performers,
                                musicians and curators to present and discuss their work, share new ideas, work and
                                party hard.
                                <!-- The graphic identity for the 2015 festival was developed by the Resonate team and FIELD.io, and is described as NEON TRIBAL PLAYGROUND CULTURE - and it informed the direction for all graphic, web and motion design relating to the festival.-->
                                <br /><br />
                                For the trailer, FIELD collaborated with director / designer Antar Walker to bring
                                their graphic identity for the festival into motion.
                            </div>

                                I was approached by FIELD to collaborate with the team on the musical score and
                                sound design for the piece.
                                <!-- The brief was to produce something as playful, human, optimistic but still contemporary as the identity itself, incorporating tribal sounds and percussion whilst still retaining an air of exploration and ambition.-->
                                <br /><br />
                                I immediately brought my long-suffering friend and collaborator Ragnar Hrafnkelsson
                                on board, and together we composed, mixed and mastered the final soundtrack.
                                <br /><br />
                                In addition to receiving considerable coverage online, the trailer was also aired on
                                Serbian national TV in the run-up to the festival opening.

                                headphones.<br /><br />
                                We then turn out the lights, allowing their non-visual senses to become heightened,
                                and their concerns about &#8216;who&#8217;s watching?&#8217; to gently
                                dissipate.<br /><br />
                                We live in a world in which, although our minds are able to travel virtually great
                                distances daily, our bodies can often fall into a routine of the same movements of
                                waking, dressing, commuting to work, sitting in front of a computer &#8211; all day,
                                every day.
                                <br /><br />
                                This is in parallel with an increase in visual stimulation &#8211; brightly coloured
                                billboards, TV, magazines, fashion &#8211; whereas our other senses, touch, smell,
                                and most importantly hearing (with the exception of music, which we use to shut out
                                the world), often get left behind.<br /><br />
                                Our work plays with both of these ideas, creating an environment where the audience
                                is able to relax in their own space, and concentrate on different sensory
                                experiences.<br /><br />
                                To enjoy freedom of movement both through direct instruction and abstract
                                inspiration.<br /><br />

                                This was a piece created in three short days in conjunction the Barbican&#8217;s
                                OpenLAB programme.<br /><br />
                                Taking place in the black box theatre, deep in the base of the sprawling Barbican
                                estate, we wanted to take advantage of the near-complete darkness we could achieve,
                                coupled with access to the technical equipment on-site, and the theatrical
                                experience of Brynja &amp; Nanna.<br /><br />
                                What emerged out of the three days was a prototype-form show, lasting around twenty
                                minutes, involving multi-channel audio playback to individual&#8217;s headphones
                                (which we used to create magic moments like &#8216;touch based hearing&#8217;),
                                playing with clashing and coherent smells / sounds, polyrhythmic clapping exercises,
                                and finally a session in led movement resulting in wild abandon!
                                <br /><br />
                                We were able to spy the performance (which took place in pitch darkness) via a
                                series of infra-red cameras and illuminators feeding to backstage, in order to
                                properly time auditory cues and effects.

                                &#8216;The Glitch&#8217; was a highly secretive and unusual campaign launched by
                                Microsoft, CP+B and B-Reel that took players on a journey across the Internet,
                                challenging them to solve puzzles and crack codes to win a mysterious
                                prize.<br /><br />
                                This formed part of the UK XBox One launch, and part of Microsoft&#8217;s effort to
                                engage directly with hardcore gamers by working on their level.<br /><br />
                                The glitch took the form of a 1 second &#8216;disruption&#8217; to the Xbox TV
                                commercial that had already been on regular rotation on UK TV channels for some
                                time. Hidden within this were a number of codes and clues that would set players off
                                on their journey.

                                I headed up the development side of the project team at B-Reel, and was responsible
                                for laying out this network of cryptic sites across the web in such a way as to give
                                no clue as to who, or what was behind the Glitch. <br /><br />
                                A sophisticated PHP backend system was built to monitor and control all the various
                                endpoints to allow tracking of players as they moved through the contest, and
                                shutting off routes as soon as prizes had been awarded.<br /><br />
                                In addition, I was also responsible for the glitched-up sound design across all of
                                the routes, which added to the air of mystery and suspense surrounding the
                                campaign.<br /><br /> Or, in the words of one contestant, making them
                                &#8216;literally shit his pants&#8217;.<br /><br />

                                Kuafu is an interactive art installation based on the Chinese myth of the giant that
                                tried to catch the Sun.<br /><br />
                                The installation itself comprises of a large, wide-format projection of a 3d
                                landscape, through which the Giant walks, braving weather, mountains, and seas in
                                his quest to catch the Sun which is causing a drought amongst his
                                people.<br /><br />
                                The topography, rivers, oceans and weather are all based on actual data drawn in
                                from live APIs and Google Maps, and visitors can control his path using a mounted
                                tablet running a web-based interface showing where in the world Kuafu is
                                walking.<br /><br />
                                I joined the fantastic Yi-Wen Lin and Bertrand Cararra on this project in part as an
                                entry for Google&#8217;s DevArt competition, in which we made it through to the
                                final 10 entrants!<br /><br />
                            </div>
                            <div class="bodyTextCol six columns">
                                My role on this project was as sound designer and composer, but as you can see from
                                the development diary below, we intended to involve as much generative, code-based
                                audio as possible in this project to fit with the 3D aesthetic in the visuals. This
                                will involve extensive work in Pure Data, as well as controlling Ableton Live via
                                OSC from Node.js.<br /><br />
                                I also worked on the Weather API, translating the incoming latitude/longitude
                                coordinates from the visual engine into data concerning wind speed, direction, and
                                rainfall, so our Giant would have to face the same elements as he would do in the
                                real world at that location!<br /><br />Also I managed the initial motion capture
                                sessions with live actors to give Kuafu some real personality in his movements.

                                Dynamics is an installation comprised of a room of constantly evolving, generative
                                and reactive music, lights and visuals that visitors can interact with via their
                                smartphones.<br /><br /> Upon joining the installation&#8217;s Wi-Fi network, every
                                visitor is presented with a slightly different interface on their smartphones, each
                                with a different level or type of influence over their surroundings. The interaction
                                types will be various, ranging from being able to trigger short sounds, through to
                                changing the overall mood of the music. Some interfaces will encourage interaction
                                with other visitors, prompting teamwork and social (as well as musical)
