							<p>One day, you wake up and find yourself trapped in a transparent box in a hostile, barren landscape. It appears that you're not alone. There is the Caretaker, who says they just want to keep you safe inside this box, promising to show you wonders beyond imagining. There are the Others, individuals trapped in boxes just as you are - some of whom are acting strangely. And the Voice in your head - together all of them are talking, acting, behaving at odds with one another - so who will you believe?

							<p class="small">Parallel People is a light-hearted interactive group VR show by Huldufugl. Based on their international award-winning solo VR experience 'Kassinn / A Box In The Desert', it expands the narrative to allow five audience members to determine their own story against a barrage of conflicting voices.</p>
							<p class="small">The show takes place entirely in VR using the Oculus Quest headset. Most eyewear can be worn during the show, but large headwear may need to be removed. The show may not be suitable for photosensitive audiences, and anyone suffering from extreme vertigo or motion sickness should be aware there is a small amount of motion within the show.

							<p>This short film in VR is an spin-off project from Huldufugl and Hikapee's (equally ambitious) stage show, The Hidden People, after that project was delayed by a year due to the pandemic.</p>
							<p>We've been collaborating with UK aerial circus company Hikapee since 2018 on a large-scale stage production - but when it became apparent that we were going to have to pause work on it for at least a year, we came up with the idea of producing an animated VR short film using the same performers, set in the same world, but with a brand new storyline.</p>
							<p>The first step was to find a motion capture company brave enough to work with tumbling, spinning circus performers using silks, trapeze and counterbalancing equipment - a real challenge for the tracking system - and then do the entire thing on location, whilst adhering to strict COVID-19 safety measures.</p>
							<p>We were extremely lucky to find a partner in Target3D, who sent an incredible crew to join our artists in isolation at 101 Outdoor Arts in Newbury for a week. Under Bryony from Hikapee's direction, they recorded an entire narrative of aerial circus-infused action.</p>
						</section>
						<section>
							<p>The film is currently under production with all the virtual sets, characters, lighting and composition currently under way.</p>
							<p>It's a unique challenge to produce animated work for VR - where almost anything is possible in terms of angles, lighting, sound and set design. For our piece, we're taking a lot of cues from theatre over film in terms of set layout and the audience's relationship to the performers - but this still leaves us a huge possibility space to play with, which is extremely exciting!</p>
							<p>We're also aiming for a unique art style that represents the Icelandic nature - acheived through procedural modelling in Houdini, taking the rough outlines of landscapes, and 'shredding' them into thousands of small, individually coloured polygons. This approach retains sharp edges in VR even up-close, without using textures, whilst also giving us fine control over colour, pre-baked static lighting, and vertex shader effects like wind movement in trees, water and moss.</p>
							<p>Release is scheduled for early 2022, for Oculus Quest and other major VR platforms.</p>

							<p> In 2017, my studio Horizons (along with co-founder Yuli Levtov and David Li) were approached by Chris Milk and Aaron Koblin's VR powerhouse Within to help them develop an incredibly ambitious VR project in collaboration with Oculus Studios, and the musical / creative force of OKGO.</p>
							<p class="small">The task was to create an experience in VR where the user could produce their very own pop song, complete with drums, bass, guitar, synth, vocals (recorded and auto-tuned by the user!) and a special cow-based freestyle solo instrument.</p>
							<p class="small">The final piece includes a staggering amount of layers of animation, machine learning, audio analysis and processing, a custom sound engine, hand interaction and musical theory.</p>

							<p>In 2018 we were very excited to give the world a peek of the final piece, at both Tribeca Film Festival and Sonar+ in Barcelona.</p>
							<p>Two audience members at a time, carefully guided by white-coated docents, could collaborate on building a song together in a purpose-built booth. The piece attracted a significant amount of positive attention, being described as 'Social VR's Rock Band' by Wired, and others.</p>
							<p>My role as lead developer ranged from prototyping musical interaction concepts at the start of the project, to co-ordinating the fantastic development team across several different cities and time zones, overseeing the asset pipeline of animated creatures from the art team into Unity, and working directly on various parts of the project.</p>
							<p>We're excited for the final public release of the project, to see the music people make in the Menagerie of the Holy Cow!</p>

						<section>
							<p>During my time with Volta, we were thrilled to collaborate with world-renowned musician and innovator Imogen Heap to create the official video for her single Last Night Of An Empire.</p>
									
							<p>Volta had at that point been developing its AR capabilities, particularly by integrating Keijiro Takahashi's Rcam2 library, which allowed us to easily integrate a real camera feed from a LIDAR-equipped iPad with 3D objects and visuals generated in Unity, and be able to freely move the camera around the space.</p>
								
							<p>True to her experimental and open spirit, Imogen decided that the recording of the video would also be live-streamed, meaning everything from the camera movment to AR visual effects and Imogen's choreography were repeated and refined over and over again and streamed to Youtube, whilst we searched for the perfect take.</p>
								
							<p>Imogen's loyal legion of Heapsters provided encouragement and comment via the stream, and after just over three hours, the final take was in the bag. But it didn't end there - we also produced a standalone VR-only version of the video to be included as an archived performance inside of Volta.</p>
							
						</section>
						<section>
							<p>Ahead of the recording at Imogen's barn studio space in Essex, I got to work creating visual elements in Houdini + Unity, and exposing parameters for on-set creative technologist Alexis Michallek to hook up to the Ableton session running the show so he could choreograph the AR visuals in time with the playback.</p>
									
							<p>For the VR version, along with several new visual effects, I built several extensions to the Unity Timeline system to allow me to work quickly with the existing Volta setup and create a tightly synced experience (separate to the livestreamed video).</p>
								
							<p>The VR video is unfortunately only available inside Volta VR, but you can catch a 2D recording of it <strong><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/11PpR73vVSiCCLG0utNBfiqbgnB5jljt8/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank">here</a></strong></p>

							<p>A collaboration between Hikapee Theatre and Huldufugl, The Hidden People is a show for medium to large stages (500 capacity+) that combines Icelandic folklore, circus/ aerial arts, performance and creative technology.</p>
							<p>Our story concerns the Hidden People, beings of uncertain benevolence often held responsible in Icelandic stories for both sudden good fortune and disappearances, unexpected occurrences and madness.</p>
							<p>We are using these tales to present modern environmental issues, specifically the building of hydroelectric dams in Iceland.</p>						
						</section>
						<section>
							<p>Hikapee approached us at Huldufugl to collaborate on this piece, and for us to join our skills with creative technology to their high-flying aerial storytelling abilities.</p>
							<p>During the research and development process, we experimented with different technologies to animate this world - and settled on large-scale projection mapping, using both the set and the performers themselves as a canvas</p>
							<p>We ended up having projected visuals for the entire duration of the show (90 minutes). I used Houdini and Unity to model and render the scenes, working in realtime during rehearsals, then rendering out high-resolution HAP video for playback in most cases, with a few scenes exported as live Unity apps, controlled with an Xbox gamepad live during shows, which is still a little nerve-racking!</p>
							<p>Playback was handled using a large custom-made TouchDesigner setup, responding to OSC from Qlab, and handling realtime post-effects such as ripples, and mapping the two projectors onto the stage.</p>
							<p>Finally, after several years of rehearsals, covid-induced delays and fundraising, the world premiere took place at Worthing Pavilion Theatre in March 2022. The show plans to be touring worldwide from August 2022.</p>

							<p>Out Of Sync is a mad idea, an experimental performance formed in response to the
								COVID-19 pandemic. So obviously in 2020 many artists across the world are unable to
								perform to audiences of more than a handful of people (at best), and those countries
								where audiences <em>can</em> gather in numbers have achieved this largely through
								(sensibly) strict border restrictions, meaning they are unable to invite
								international artists to come and play. In addition to this, the global climate
								crisis remains &#8211; albeit backgrounded a bit by the pandemic. 
							</p>
							<p>The idea is that a performer in Iceland (at the time gatherings were limited to 10
								people or fewer) would live-stream to a club in Taipei, Taiwan. There, a full
								audience of dancing people (Taiwan had no gathering restrictions at the time) would
								enjoy the party. However, we had two dancers, or &#8220;eyes&#8221; inside the club,
								using mobile phones to provide a two-way video stream <em>back</em> to Reykjavik,
								where two people at a time would experience the party on the other side of the world
								inside large wooden booths specially built for the purpose.</p>

							<p>Now a 90 minute performance, regardless of how great the music is or colourful his
								onesie is, might not be the most visually interesting experience if it was
								a simple camera setup. Luckily, I had been working for several months with my
								long-suffering collaborator Yuli Levtov on an exciting new project called Volta,
								which aims to make it easy for performing artists to create visually engaging
								livestream experiences, either for 2d video streaming or in VR.</p>
							<p>Even more luckily, the month before, we had integrated Keijiro Takahashi&#8217;s
								outstanding Rcam2 system into Volta&#8217;s existing visual system, allowing us to
								do a full AR performance using only an iPad Pro and a laptop running Unity + Touch
								Designer.</p>
							<p>We're super happy with the results, which you can watch above, and excited to
								see where this new medium can take us. Since then we&#8217;ve incorporated a
								user-facing editor into the Volta product, which you can read more about below. In
								addition, this same team has applied to produce several more events during 2021 to
								investigate alternate means of performance and audience experience &#8211; both as
								the world recovers from the pandemic, and as we look forwards to ways to reduce the
								burden of extensive travel on artists wanting to perform outside of their home
								countries, whilst still making it a party!</p>
