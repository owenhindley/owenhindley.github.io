		&#8216;The Glitch&#8217; was a highly secretive and unusual campaign
		launched by Microsoft, CP+B and B-Reel that took players on a journey across
		the Internet, challenging them to solve puzzles and crack codes to win a
		mysterious prize.
	</p>
	<p>
		This formed part of the UK XBox One launch, and part of Microsoft&#8217;s
		effort to engage directly with hardcore gamers by working on their level.
		The glitch took the form of a 1 second &#8216;disruption&#8217; to the Xbox
		TV collaboration that had already been on regular rotation on UK TV channels
		for some time. Hidden within this were a number of codes and clues that
		would set players off on their journey.

		I headed up the development side of the project team at B-Reel, and was
		responsible for laying out this network of cryptic sites across the web in
		such a way as to give no clue as to who, or what was behind the Glitch.
	</p>
	<p>
		A sophisticated PHP backend system was built to monitor and control all the
		various endpoints to allow tracking of players as they moved through the
		contest, and shutting off routes as soon as prizes had been awarded.
	</p>
	<p>
		In addition, I was also responsible for the glitched-up sound design across
		all of the routes, which added to the air of mystery and suspense
		surrounding the campaign.
