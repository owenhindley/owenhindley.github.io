        Since I was a student I've gone through stages of performing
        as a visualist alongside musicians for concerts, raves and
        club events.
    </p>
    <p>
        Starting when Pendulum came to our university in 2007, and I
        (unprompted) threw together a bunch of pre-rendered footage
        into Resolume and jammed it out, I've loved the experience of
        playing with images live, responding to the music as it comes.
    </p>
    <p>
        Since then it's been a nice offshoot of my regular practice,
        which often involves making some kind of real-time system for
        visuals anyway.

        In the beginning of 2023 it's received a bit of a boost with a
        bunch of underground, DIY-ish shows in Reykjavík, and I've
        developed a TouchDesigner-based system to be able to show up
        and perform pretty much anywhere, including live control over
        any lights in the venue, multiple projectors, that kind of
        thing.
    </p>
    <p>
        Often things I learn from doing this makes its way back into
        my 'professional' work, little visual tricks, or some weird
        combination of effects that you end up coming up with in the
        moment.
