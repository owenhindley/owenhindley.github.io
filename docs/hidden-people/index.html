	<h4>
		A collaboration between Hikapee Theatre and Huldufugl, a show for medium to
		large stages that combines Icelandic folklore, circus arts, theatre and
		creative technology.
	</h4>
</section>

<!-- <section>
    <p>Our story concerns the Hidden People, beings of uncertain benevolence often held responsible in Icelandic stories
        for both sudden good fortune and disappearances, unexpected occurrences and madness.</p>
    <p>We are using these tales to present modern environmental issues, specifically the building of hydroelectric dams
        in Iceland.</p>
</section> -->
<section>
	<!-- <p>Hikapee approached us at Huldufugl to collaborate on this piece, and for us to join our skills with creative
        technology to their high-flying aerial storytelling abilities.</p>
    <p>During the research and development process, we experimented with different technologies to animate this world -
        and settled on large-scale projection mapping, using both the set and the performers themselves as a canvas</p> -->

		With projected visuals for the entire duration of the show (90 minutes), I
		used Houdini and Unity to design and render the scenes, working in realtime
		during rehearsals, then rendering out high-resolution HAP video.<br/>
		<br/>
		Playback was handled using a custom-made TouchDesigner app, receiving cues
		via OSC from Qlab, running realtime effects on top of the video, and
		handling the projection mapping.

		Whilst most of the scenes are purely video playback in most cases, with a
		few scenes are exported as live Unity apps, controlled with an Xbox gamepad
		live during shows, which just to keep things exciting!<br/><br/>
	</p>

	<p>
		Finally, after several years of rehearsals, covid-induced delays and
		fundraising, the world premiere took place at Worthing Pavilion Theatre in
		March 2022. The show plans to be touring worldwide from August 2022.
