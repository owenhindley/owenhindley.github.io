		One day, you wake up and find yourself trapped in a transparent box in a
		hostile, barren landscape - but it appears you're not alone.
	</p>
    <p>
		There is the Caretaker, who says they just want to keep you safe inside this
		box, promising to show you wonders beyond imagining.
	</p>
    <p>
		There are the Others, individuals trapped in boxes just as you are - some of
		whom are acting strangely.
	</p>
    <p>
		And the Voice in your head - together all of them are talking, acting,
		behaving at odds with one another - so who will you believe?

		Based on my theatre company Huldufugl's international award-winning VR
		experience 'Kassinn / A Box In The Desert' (one of the world's first
		experiences of its kind), this show expands the narrative to allow five
		audience members to determine their own story against a barrage of
		conflicting voices.
	</p>
    <p>
		My role on this project was lead developer, director and live show operator,
		with the concept and script co-created by the whole amazing team.
	</p>
    <p>The show takes place entirely in VR using the Oculus Quest headset.</p>
