	<h4>
		I met Dustin for the first time in late 2023, whilst in the gym at
		Hafnarhaus (our wonderful co-working space in downtown ReykjavÃ­k), a notable
		encounter not just because I'm so rarely anywhere near a gym, but also
		because it resulted in him asking me to create a visual piece to accompany a
		track on his new album, 1 0 0 1.
	</h4>
	<p>
		'Harmonic Dream Sequence', in his words, is a psychedelic depiction of the
		current naive desire to experiment with technology, with a lack of concern
		for some possible future where it gains autonomy from its creators and
		users.
	</p>
	<p>
		This really resonated with me, and so I set about trying to create a visual
		system that would capture both the complexity and scale of this AI-driven
		future, hinting at the anxiety-inducing speed, the unknowable biases buried
		deep within it, and also look kinda cool.
	</p>

	/>
	<p>
		The resulting video is intended to be a poetic visualisation of both the
		wonder and anxiety produced by our collective ability to develop technology
		that not only reflects our own world back at us in unsettling, distorted and
		disruptive ways, but how it can also - through modern neural networks and
		'AI' systems - appear to create new worlds for us to explore.
	</p>
	<p>
		Created in TouchDesigner, and using a mix of real LIDAR scans and simulated
		(hallucinated?) depth scans, millions of particles represent the raw data we
		feed into these ever-hungry machines. At first they form strange,
		uncomfortable shapes which periodically resolve into recognisable forms
		before collapsing again into chaos. Then structure emerges, as we train the
		system to recognise connections, patterns and layers in the data, before we
		dive into it, triggering chaotic lightning flashes of connection between
		disparate pieces of data, and producing unexpected outputs at incredible
		speed.

	/>
	<p>
		But despite having access to an entire Internet's representation of reality
		and the results of incredible computing power, we're left with a uneasy
		feeling at the results, the ghostly, dreamlike sensations it leaves us with
		making us ask uncomfortable questions about our own minds, and the future it
		beckons us towards.
