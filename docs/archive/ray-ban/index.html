        To celebrate the 75th Anniversary of the Ray-Ban brand, a site
        was commissioned that allowed the user to literally scroll
        through the decades, highlighting on the way inspirational
        stories of individuals that represented the brand's “NEVER
        HIDE” philosophy.

        As part of the team at B-Reel, I acted as lead developer on
        the project, delivering an unparalleled premium HTML5
        experience across tablet and desktop.
