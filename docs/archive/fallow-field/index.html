        Shot over 8 days in the Surrey Hills, this collaboration
        between first-time director and Leigh Dovey and producer Colin
        Arnold matches the beauty of English countryside at
        harvesttime with the savage and the supernatural. The film was
        snapped up for international distribution shortly after
        completing post production, and has appeared at film festivals
        across the UK.
