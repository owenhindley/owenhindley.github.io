        RAVE allows VJs, conference graphics operators, editors and
        other video professionals a unique method of editing and
        displaying video content live, in real-time.

    <p>
        Using a networked system of ordinary PCs, the user can create
        frame-accurate sequences from existing source material,
        combine them with other clips or sequences, then instantly
        assign them for playback on any or all of the attached
        machines.
    </p>

    <p>
        The interface is multitouch-compatible, which required (in the
        pre-Windows 7 world) re-writing the standard Windows input API
        to take advantage of the additional input.

    <p>
        Concept, interface design, video playback engine and
        networking were created specifically for the project.
