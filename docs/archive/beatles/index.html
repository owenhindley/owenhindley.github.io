        The Fab Four's much-publicised arrival on iTunes was
        accompanied by a set of exclusive iTunes LPs to accompany
        album purchases.
    </p>
    <p>
        Users downloading entire albums would recieve an interactive
        digital pack (the iTunes LP) containing artwork, liner notes
        and historical notes.
    </p>

        I was part of the in-house team at Metropolis Group that
        authored each of the 17 LPs in time for the release. iTunes LP
        authoring, extensive HTML/jScript/CSS3 development and Webkit
        animation.
