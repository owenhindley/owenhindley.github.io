        Say What?! is a fast and fun new music game that gets your
        brain and your fingers movingâ€¦And helps you learn the right
        lyrics to your favourite songs!

        On its worldwide launch, the game immediately hit the No.1
        spot in the Top Free-Music category on the App Store, and has
        received coverage in the Guardian & London's Metro newspapers.

        I was part of the two-man development team at 8linQ
        responsible for delivering the app. As well as the game
        itself, a back-end infrastructure was also developed in-house
        to deliver in-app purchase content and provide a
        Facebook-integrated leaderboard mechanic.
