		In 2017, my studio Horizons (with co-founders Yuli Levtov and David Li) was
		approached by Chris Milk and Aaron Koblin's VR powerhouse Within to help
		them develop an incredibly ambitious VR project in collaboration with Oculus
		Studios, and the musical / creative force of OKGO.
	</p>
	<p>
		The task was to create an experience in VR where the user could produce
		their very own pop song, complete with drums, bass, guitar, synth, vocals
		(recorded and auto-tuned by the user) and a special cow-based freestyle solo
		instrument.

		The final piece includes a staggering amount of layers of animation, machine
		learning, audio analysis and processing, a custom sound engine, VR
		interaction and musical theory.
	</p>

	<p>
		In 2018 we were very excited to give the world a peek of the final piece, at
		both Tribeca Film Festival and Sonar+ in Barcelona.
	</p>
	<p>
		Two audience members at a time, carefully guided by white-coated docents,
		could collaborate on building a song together in a purpose-built booth. The
		piece attracted a significant amount of positive attention, being described
		as 'Social VR's Rock Band' by Wired, and others.
	</p>
	<p>
		My role as lead developer ranged from prototyping musical interaction
		concepts at the start of the project, to co-ordinating the fantastic
		development team across several different cities and time zones, overseeing
		the asset pipeline of animated creatures from the art team into Unity, and
		working directly on various parts of the project.
	</p>
	<p>
		Released on 25th December 2022, we're excited to see what people create with
		this fantastic musical tool!
