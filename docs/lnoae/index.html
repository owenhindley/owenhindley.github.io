	<h4>
		During my time with Volta, we were thrilled to collaborate with
		world-renowned musician and innovator Imogen Heap to create the official
		video for her single Last Night Of An Empire.
	</h4>
</section>
<section>
	<p>
		Volta had at that point been developing its AR capabilities, particularly by
		integrating Keijiro Takahashi's Rcam2 library, which allowed us to easily
		integrate a real camera feed from a LIDAR-equipped iPad with 3D objects and
		visuals generated in Unity, and be able to freely move the camera around the
		space.
	</p>

	<p>
		True to her experimental and open spirit, Imogen decided that the recording
		of the video would also be live-streamed, meaning everything from the camera
		movment to AR visual effects and Imogen's choreography were repeated and
		refined over and over again and streamed to Youtube, whilst we searched for
		the perfect take.
	</p>

	<p>
		Imogen's loyal legion of Heapsters provided encouragement and comment via
		the stream, and after just over three hours, the final take was in the bag.
		But it didn't end there - we also produced a standalone VR-only version of
		the video to be included as an archived performance inside of Volta.
	</p>
</section>
<section>
	<p>
		Ahead of the recording at Imogen's barn studio space in Essex, I got to work
		creating visual elements in Houdini + Unity, and exposing parameters for
		on-set creative technologist Alexis Michallek to hook up to the Ableton
		session running the show so he could choreograph the AR visuals in time with
		the playback.
	</p>

	<p>
		For the VR version, along with several new visual effects, I built several
		extensions to the Unity Timeline system to allow me to work quickly with the
		existing Volta setup and create a tightly synced experience (separate to the
		livestreamed video).
	</p>

	<p>
		The VR video is unfortunately only available inside Volta VR, but you can
		catch a 2D recording of it
