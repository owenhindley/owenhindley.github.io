		The Moon Seat is a playful installation that entertains our inner child
		whilst simultaneously courting long forgotten childhood fears. The
		installation had its first public outing at the
		<strong>e-Luminate</strong> festival in Cambridge, UK from 12th-17th
		February 2016, and was located on the front lawn of the prestigious
		Cambridge Union Society.
	</p>

	<p>
		Audience members were invited to sit, at which point the pool of moonlight
		would instantly open to show their shadow. After a few seconds, their shadow
		would transform into an animal controlled by their bodily movements, but
		with a character all of its own. An ethereal generative soundtrack reacting
		to the user's movements accompanies the piece.

		I'd worked with Alex for a long time at B-Reel, and I was very excited to be
		asked to get involved in his first independent installation art piece! It
		quickly became apparent that we were going to need some more help, so we
		drafted in ex-B-Reelers and good friends Yi-Wen Lin and Christian Persson to
		come on board.
	</p>

	<p>
		We pulled in quite a variety of technologies for this one, including
		<a href="http://processing.org" target="_blank">Processing</a>
		(main show),
		<a href="http://nwjs.io" target="_blank">NodeWebkit</a>
		(gesture detection &amp; tracking),
		<a href="http://labs.adobe.com/technologies/flashruntimes/" target="_blank"
			>Flash/AIR</a
		>
		(character animation &amp; playback) and
		<a href="http://puredata.info/" target="_blank">Pure Data</a>
		(generative audio &amp; DMX control)
