    <!-- <p>This short film in VR is an spin-off project from Huldufugl and Hikapee's (equally ambitious) stage show, The
        Hidden People, after that project was delayed by a year due to the pandemic.</p>
    <p>We've been collaborating with UK aerial circus company Hikapee since 2018 on a large-scale stage production - but
        when it became apparent that we were going to have to pause work on it for at least a year, we came up with the
        idea of producing an animated VR short film using the same performers, set in the same world, but with a brand
        new storyline.</p>
    <p>The first step was to find a motion capture company brave enough to work with tumbling, spinning circus
        performers using silks, trapeze and counterbalancing equipment - a real challenge for the tracking system - and
        then do the entire thing on location, whilst adhering to strict COVID-19 safety measures.</p>
    <p>We were extremely lucky to find a partner in Target3D, who sent an incredible crew to join our artists in
        isolation at 101 Outdoor Arts in Newbury for a week. Under Bryony from Hikapee's direction, they recorded an
        entire narrative of aerial circus-infused action.</p>
    <p>The film is currently under production with all the virtual sets, characters, lighting and composition currently
        under way.</p>
    <p>It's a unique challenge to produce animated work for VR - where almost anything is possible in terms of angles,
        lighting, sound and set design. For our piece, we're taking a lot of cues from theatre over film in terms of set
        layout and the audience's relationship to the performers - but this still leaves us a huge possibility space to
        play with, which is extremely exciting!</p>
    <p>We're also aiming for a unique art style that represents the Icelandic nature - acheived through procedural
        modelling in Houdini, taking the rough outlines of landscapes, and 'shredding' them into thousands of small,
        individually coloured polygons. This approach retains sharp edges in VR even up-close, without using textures,
        whilst also giving us fine control over colour, pre-baked static lighting, and vertex shader effects like wind
        movement in trees, water and moss.</p> -->
    <p>
        Work in progress! Upon release, the piece will be available
        for Oculus Quest and other major VR platforms.

        Since I was a student I've gone through stages of performing
        as a visualist alongside musicians for concerts, raves and
        club events.
    </p>
    <p>
        Starting when Pendulum came to our university in 2007, and I
        (unprompted) threw together a bunch of pre-rendered footage
        into Resolume and jammed it out, I've loved the experience of
        playing with images live, responding to the music as it comes.
    </p>
    <p>
        Since then it's been a nice offshoot of my regular practice,
        which often involves making some kind of real-time system for
        visuals anyway.

        In the beginning of 2023 it's received a bit of a boost with a
        bunch of underground, DIY-ish shows in Reykjavík, and I've
        developed a TouchDesigner-based system to be able to show up
        and perform pretty much anywhere, including live control over
        any lights in the venue, multiple projectors, that kind of
        thing.
    </p>
    <p>
        Often things I learn from doing this makes its way back into
        my 'professional' work, little visual tricks, or some weird
        combination of effects that you end up coming up with in the
        moment.

    <p>One day, you wake up and find yourself trapped in a transparent box in a hostile, barren landscape - but it appears you're not alone.</p>
    <p> There is the Caretaker, who says they just want to keep you safe inside this box,
        promising to show you wonders beyond imagining.</p>
        <p> There are the Others, individuals trapped in boxes just as you
        are - some of whom are acting strangely.</p>
        <p> And the Voice in your head - together all of them are talking, acting,
        behaving at odds with one another - so who will you believe?

    <p>Based on my theatre company Huldufugl's international award-winning VR experience 'Kassinn / A Box In The Desert' (one of the world's first experiences of its kind), this show expands the narrative to
        allow five audience members to determine their own story against a barrage of conflicting voices.</p>
    <p>My role on this project was lead developer, director and live show operator, with the concept and script co-created by the whole amazing team.</p>
    <p>The show takes place entirely in VR using the Oculus Quest headset.</p>

        minutes), I used Houdini and Unity to design and render the
        scenes, working in realtime during rehearsals, then rendering
        out high-resolution HAP video.<br />
        <br />
        Playback was handled using a custom-made TouchDesigner app,
        receiving cues via OSC from Qlab, running realtime effects on
        top of the video, and handling the projection mapping.
    </p>
    <p>
        Whilst most of the scenes are purely video playback in most
        cases, with a few scenes are exported as live Unity apps,
        controlled with an Xbox gamepad live during shows, which just
        to keep things exciting!<br /><br />
        Finally, after several years of rehearsals, covid-induced
        delays and fundraising, the world premiere took place at
        Worthing Pavilion Theatre in March 2022. The show plans to be
        touring worldwide from August 2022.

        <h4>A short platform experience about using the wind to guide your way.</h4>
       
</section>

<section>
        <p>Created for the Isle of Games 002 (see <a href="http://isleofgames.is">isleofgames.is</a>) exhibition on the
                theme of &#8220;The Tempest&#8221;, the player is making their way through a pitch
                black world, with nothing but the wind to guide their path.</p>
        <p>The installation version was for two people to cooperate, one using a joystick to
                control the character, the other using rotating lava rock + button to control the
                wind. This version is just controlled using the keyboard.</p>

        One of the world's first pieces of its kind, the show explores
        what happens by smashing together future-thinking theatre
        forms with technology.
    </p>
    <p>
        Created by Huldufugl (an Icelandic / British events company
        co-founded by myself and writer, actress &amp; producer Nanna
        Gunnars), the piece is a mix of Virtual Reality, multiplayer
        gaming and interactive theatre.
    </p>
    <p>
        The concept initially began as a short play by Nanna, written
        and performed in a conventional theatre in 2016 &#8211; after
        which I put forward the idea to re-create this piece in VR. We
        premiered the first version in Reykjavík in August 2017, and
        developed it for a longer run in July 2018, before taking the
        show to the Stockholm Fringe Festival in September 2018, and
        with more international dates planned for 2019!
    </p>
    <p>
        One person at a time experiences the piece inside of a 2 x 2m
        physical space, whilst the actor performs in a separate
        physical space. For our first outing, we used the Xsens motion
        capture suit (expertly handled by
        <a href="http://puppit.is" target="_blank">PuppIT</a>), but
        currently the show involves two Oculus Rift setups, sharing
        the same virtual space using multiplayer networking.
    </p>
    <p>
        Show control is handled by an operator, who can observe and
        control both events in the world and the &#8216;voice in your
        head&#8217; via a Qlab interface, and we have a beautiful LED
        box created by Swedish engineering magicians
        <a href="http://svartljus.se" target="_blank">Svartljus</a>
    </p>
    <p>
        After touring the piece throughout Europe and to the USA, we
        went back into the rehearsal room to re-create the experience
        for more than one audience member at a time. The result is
        Hliðstætt Fólk / Parallel People, which you can read more
        about above.

    <p>After a chance introduction in Iceland via the wonderful people at <a
            href="http://www.bedroomcommunity.net/">Bedroom Community</a>, I was invited to
        submit a proposal for a launch title for Google&#8217;s new VR headset, Daydream.
    </p>
    <p>I contacted my long-term collaborator Yuli Levtov and together with our friends David
        Li and Leif Podhajsky, we laid out plans to create the first music-focused title for
        this new platform.</p>
</section>
<section>
    <p>After launch, in collaboration with Ninja Tune heavyweight artist
        Bonobo, the Horizons team (Yuli Levtov, David Li, Leif Podhajsky and myself) saddled up again to
        create a brand new psychedelic interactive music journey for the Horizons platform
        on Google Daydream.</p>

    <p>The new scene features the track Outlier from his latest album Migration, and allows
        you to deeply interact with the music, which in turn has an effect on the landscape
        you fly through. Flocks of birds join you on your journey through sand dunes,
        towering mountains and beneath the waves.</p>

    <p>After the sad demise of the Google Daydream platform, we were approached by HTC to port the title to their range
        of devices, and it is now available on <a
            href="https://www.viveport.com/078645bd-a81e-4223-854f-b546f719d5f6">HTC Viveport</a> for HTC Vive, Focus
        and Flow.</p>

    <p>
        In 2017, my studio Horizons (with co-founders Yuli Levtov and
        David Li) was approached by Chris Milk and Aaron Koblin's VR
        powerhouse Within to help them develop an incredibly ambitious
        VR project in collaboration with Oculus Studios, and the
        musical / creative force of OKGO.
    </p>
    <p>
        The task was to create an experience in VR where the user
        could produce their very own pop song, complete with drums,
        bass, guitar, synth, vocals (recorded and auto-tuned by the
        user) and a special cow-based freestyle solo instrument.
    </p>
    <p>
        The final piece includes a staggering amount of layers of
        animation, machine learning, audio analysis and processing, a
        custom sound engine, VR interaction and musical theory.
    </p>
</section>
<section>
    <p>
        In 2018 we were very excited to give the world a peek of the
        final piece, at both Tribeca Film Festival and Sonar+ in
        Barcelona.
    </p>
    <p>
        Two audience members at a time, carefully guided by
        white-coated docents, could collaborate on building a song
        together in a purpose-built booth. The piece attracted a
        significant amount of positive attention, being described as
        'Social VR's Rock Band' by Wired, and others.
    </p>
    <p>
        My role as lead developer ranged from prototyping musical
        interaction concepts at the start of the project, to
        co-ordinating the fantastic development team across several
        different cities and time zones, overseeing the asset pipeline
        of animated creatures from the art team into Unity, and
        working directly on various parts of the project.
    </p>
    <p>
        Released on 25th December 2022, we're excited to see what
        people create with this fantastic musical tool!

    <p>So I&#8217;ve been a massive fan of Universal Everything&#8217;s work ever since
        Matt Pyke formed the studio post-Designers Republic, so being invited to join them
        as a developer on this adventure was a bit exciting, to say the least!
    </p>
    <p>
        The brief was to produce a real-time, interactive artwork that would be projected
        onto seven monumental &#8216;petals&#8217;, designed and inhabiting a space by Zaha
        Hadid Architects, within a relatively short timeframe &#8211; and with a lot of
        press attention on the final result, so no small order.</p>
</section>


<section>
    <p>
        With a tight timeline, the lead developer Chris Mullany and I developed a system for
        simulating choreographed bird-like motion onto thousands of unique
        &#8216;avatars&#8217; &#8211; playful, generative striped characters who would fly
        and dance around the space.</p>
    <p>We worked rapidly in Unity, with Chris handling the creation and rendering of the
        Avatars, and me handling the flocking motion and choreographies that would play in
        synchronicity with composed music from Simon Pyke / Freefarm.</p>
    <p>The final setup in Milan required an impressive assortment of hardware, handled by
        an amazing crew of projectionists, d3 operators, sound and lighting designers, and
        our playback rig &#8211; 6 high-end PCs running Unity apps, all synchronised via
        network from a single server, from which we could adjust and refine all aspects of
        the show once we arrived in Milan.</p>

    <p>The Moon Seat is a playful installation that entertains our inner child whilst
    simultaneously courting long forgotten childhood fears.

    The installation had its first public outing at the <strong>e-Luminate</strong>
    festival in Cambridge, UK from 12th-17th February 2016, and was located on the front
    lawn of the prestigious Cambridge Union Society.</p>

    <p>Audience members were invited to sit, at which point the pool of moonlight would
    instantly open to show their shadow. After a few seconds, their shadow would
    transform into an animal controlled by their bodily movements, but
    with a character all of its own. An ethereal generative soundtrack reacting to the
    user's movements accompanies the piece.</p>
</section>
<section>
    <p>I'd worked with Alex for a long time at B-Reel, and I was very excited to be
    asked to get involved in his first independent installation art piece!

    It quickly became apparent that we were going to need some more help, so we drafted
    in ex-B-Reelers and good friends Yi-Wen Lin and Christian Persson to come on board.</p>

    <p>We pulled in quite a variety of technologies for this one, including <a href="http://processing.org"
        target="_blank">Processing</a> (main show), <a href="http://nwjs.io" target="_blank">NodeWebkit</a> (gesture
    detection &amp;
    tracking), <a href="http://labs.adobe.com/technologies/flashruntimes/" target="_blank">Flash/AIR</a> (character
    animation &amp; playback) and <a href="http://puredata.info/" target="_blank">Pure Data</a> (generative audio
   &amp; DMX control)</p>

    HTC&#8217;s Vive VR headset.</p>

    <p>The site uses a mobile device as a controller for the 3D desktop experience, and

    <p>Sónar is an international festival of progressive music and multimedia arts,
        originally out of Barcelona, but now taking place in several locations worldwide,
        including Reykjavik since 2013.
        It is hosted in the landmark building Harpa, a beautiful structure with a unique
        interlocking cell-like front facade (designed by Olafur Eliasson) each containing an
        LED light fixture. Combined it forms a large outdoor screen that is visible across
        much of downtown Reykjavik.
    </p>

    <p>Artist Atli Bollasson and I were lucky enough to be the first outside artists to do
        something on this facade in 2014, with the publicly-playable arcade game <a
            href="http://www.owenhindley.co.uk/harpa-pong/">Harpa PONG</a> at
        Reykjavík&#8217;s Culture night.
        After the success of PONG, Harpa and the Sónar organisers invited Atli and myself to
        do a repeat installation on the lights of Harpa for the festival in 2015, and again
        in 2016.</p>
</section>


<section>
    <p>We knew we wanted to do a bit more than simply re-run PONG, so instead we decided
        &#8211; in addition to running the game &#8211; we would turn the entire building
        into an audio-reactive light show, taking the music being played inside and use it
        to drive the visuals outside.</p>

    <p>To do this we reached out to other creative developers, providing them with a code
        framework, brief, and challenge to do something amazing with only 36 x 11 pixels. We
        ended up with over 12 functioning visual responses from 8 developers from around
        Europe, which was way beyond our expectations.</p>

    <!-- The results can be seen in the video above, for three days the visuals were bouncing around to the likes of Skrillex, Todd Terje and Elliphant, and were attracting attention not only in the city of Reykjavik, but also (we happily realised) inside the venue as well, where we accidentally became the main lightshow for the SonarPub stage. -->

    <p>mmorph is an adventure into new ways of delivering interactive music in the browser
    and beyond.<br/><br/>

A collaboration between global music agency MassiveMusic, Reactify Music, Grotesk,
    Enzien Audio and myself, mmorph is an example of a new workflow which we hope will
    open up many possibilities for interactive audio &#8211; first in the browser, and
    then for games, apps, installations and VR.</p>
<p>The site takes you through an interactive music piece, enabling different musical
    parts, applying realtime effects, composing and looping a top-line synth, and
    creating intense build-ups and drops!</p>

</section>

<section>
   <p> My role was lead developer on the project, handling the integration of the audio
    code from Reactify &#038; Enzien Audio (who in turn were working with original music
    composed by Massive) with realtime SVG graphics and animations art-directed by
    Grotesk.</p>

<p>The interactive audio was produced via a unique workflow where Reactify worked
    rapidly and closely with Massive&#8217;s in-house composer in Pure Data, an visual
    programming environment that allows for real-time prototyping and development.</p>

<p>This Pure Data &#8216;patch&#8217; was then converted to run in the browser via
    Enzien Audio&#8217;s <strong>Heavy</strong> compiler. This compiler can also
    transform the same source patch into code suitable for Unity, Unreal engine,
    OpenFrameworks, desktop/mobile apps and VR experiences, with little or no
    alterations to the original.</p>

        <p>For a few days in February 2016, visitors of Harpa Music Hall in Reykjavík were
                invited to play the façade of the building as they would an instrument. A
                &#8220;light organ&#8221; was placed on the 4th floor balcony, with a stunning view
                of the inside of the geometrical glass front and the downtown
                area.
        </p>
        <p>Anyone who passed through could learn how to play in blue or red or
                green, with quick flashes or swelling pads of light, and impress the whole city with
                an optical performance.</p>

    <p>Resonate is a festival that brings together artists to drive a forward-looking
    debate on the position of technology in art and culture.</p>
<p>Held annually in Belgrade, Serbia, it draws visual artists, programmers, performers,
    musicians and curators to present and discuss their work, share new ideas, work, knowledge and plum brandy.</p>
    <!-- The graphic identity for the 2015 festival was developed by the Resonate team and FIELD.io, and is described as NEON TRIBAL PLAYGROUND CULTURE - and it informed the direction for all graphic, web and motion design relating to the festival.-->

<p>For the trailer, FIELD collaborated with director / designer Antar Walker to bring
    their graphic identity for the festival into motion.</p>
</section>
<section>
<p> I was approached by FIELD to collaborate with the team on the musical score and
    sound design for the piece.
    <!-- The brief was to produce something as playful, human, optimistic but still contemporary as the identity itself, incorporating tribal sounds and percussion whilst still retaining an air of exploration and ambition.-->

    I immediately brought my long-suffering friend and collaborator Ragnar Hrafnkelsson
    on board, and together we composed, mixed and mastered the final soundtrack.</p>

<p>In addition to receiving considerable coverage online, the trailer was also aired on
    Serbian national TV in the run-up to the festival opening.</p>

<p>International agency Isobar collaborated with B-Reel and Groovy Gecko to create a
    live, web-connected experience that allowed users to smash a real-life piñata using
    a robotic arm, in order to promote the new flavours of Pringles
    Tortillas.</p>
<p>Users in the UK and Germany were able to sign up via Twitter and/or Facebook to take
    a hit at the unlucky piñata, successful entrants would win a Tortillas-related
    prize!</p>
</section>

<section>
<p>B-Reel approached me to lead the design and build of the robotic arm &#8211; a
    really fun challenge!</p>
<p>This required a lot of research into fabrication methods, and learning about
    pneumatics for the first time, combined with electronic control (via <a href="http://www.phidgets.com/"
        target="_blank">Phidgets</a>) and backend
    development to connect the entire system to the website (being developed by
    Isobar)</p>
<p>After constructing two beautiful robots (Pedro &#038; Mario, in reserve), we to work
    smashing piñatas, the arm pounding each one with 20psi of force per hit. Over 40
    piñatas a day were obliterated live online, in a custom-built Mexican marketplace
    set deep within East London.</p>

    <p>Spectra 2, a mesmerising kinetic sculpture by FIELD.io in collaboration with design
    studio Accept &#038; Proceed was displayed in the studio&#8217;s East London gallery
    space in Summer 2014.</p>
<p>The piece consists of suspended polished steel segments, controlled by stepper
    motors &#038; custom electronics, that form rippling terrains inspired by NASA lunar
    meteor impact data.</p>

<section>
    <p>Collaborating with lead engineer Laurence Symonds, FIELD and A&#038;P, I was
    responsible for the design &#038; implementation of the motor software control
    system, which played back a pre-choreographed sequence (pre-visualised and designed
    in Houdini by FIELD).
    I was also very happy to be part of the superhuman build, test &#038;
    installation team.</p>

<p>Custom Arduino firmware and a unique serial protocol needed to be developed in order
    to synchronise movement across all 48 motors for the duration of the hour-plus long
    sequence. A Node.js server was written to handle playback and synchronisation with a
    wall-mounted display, and triggering of audio samples via OSC.</p>

    <p>PONG is a massive interactive outdoor artwork that allows two people to play the
    classic game against each other on the monumental facade of Harpa, Iceland&#8217;s
    flagship concert hall in downtown Reykjavik, designed by Ólafur Eliasson.</p>

<p>Conceived and produced by Atli Bollason, the project began as a chance meeting
    between myself and Atli at a birthday party in Reykjavik, and over the next few
    months developed into a reality &#8211; with not only the CEO of the building coming
    on board very quickly, but for the first time for a project like this, Ólafur
    himself (the first time he has allowed a project like this to take over the
    facade&#8217;s lighting system). Vodafone Iceland also agreed to sponsor the
    project, and supply us with some of the equipment.</p>

<p>The project was launched on Menningarnótt (Culture Night) on the 23rd August 2014,
    and ran for a week afterwards as part of the Reykjavik Dance Festival.
    For the launch night, we setup a stage in front of the building, and players used a
    pair of phones to control their &#8216;paddles&#8217; on the 43m-high screen.
    Afterwards, players were able to join a special Wi-fi network which took them
    directly to the game, which was transmitted from a hill overlooking the building.
    This would allow them to join a virtual queue, and play against friends or complete
    strangers.</p>
</section>
<section>
<p>Our roles were split with Atli handling the concept, creative direction, project
    management and publicity, and me handling the design, hardware, networking and
    programming.</p>

<p>Three separate Node.js servers run together to create the experience; one running in
    the basement of Harpa which outputs DMX to control the 35&#215;11 pixel display (6
    universes of 512 channels each), one running in the cloud which actually simulates
    the game physics, and receives WebSocket connections from the player&#8217;s phone,
    and another which handles the game queue.</p>

<p> An HTML5 mobile front-end was also developed to give visual feedback to the player
    of their paddle, and current score.

    The code for the entire project is available on <a href="https://github.com/owenhindley/harpapong"> github</a>.</p>

    <p>&#8216;The Glitch&#8217; was a highly secretive and unusual campaign launched by
    Microsoft, CP+B and B-Reel that took players on a journey across the Internet,
    challenging them to solve puzzles and crack codes to win a mysterious
    prize.</p>
<p>This formed part of the UK XBox One launch, and part of Microsoft&#8217;s effort to
    engage directly with hardcore gamers by working on their level.
    The glitch took the form of a 1 second &#8216;disruption&#8217; to the Xbox TV
    collaboration that had already been on regular rotation on UK TV channels for some
    time. Hidden within this were a number of codes and clues that would set players off
    on their journey.</p>
</section>

<section>
<p>I headed up the development side of the project team at B-Reel, and was responsible
    for laying out this network of cryptic sites across the web in such a way as to give
    no clue as to who, or what was behind the Glitch.</p>
<p>A sophisticated PHP backend system was built to monitor and control all the various
    endpoints to allow tracking of players as they moved through the contest, and
    shutting off routes as soon as prizes had been awarded.</p>
<p>In addition, I was also responsible for the glitched-up sound design across all of
    the routes, which added to the air of mystery and suspense surrounding the
    campaign.</p>

    <p>City of Drones is an interactive digital environment developed by musician John
    Cale, speculative architect Liam Young and digital artists FIELD. Charting the story
    of a lost drone drifting through an abstract cityscape, players are invited to pilot
    a virtual craft and remotely explore this imaginary world.
</p><p> Samples from Cale’s original soundscape compositions echo across the landscape as we see the city
    through the eyes of the drone, buzzing between the buildings, drifting endlessly, in
    an ambient audio visual choreography.</p>
<p>City of Drones lives online, and as an installation at the Barbican Center, London,
    as part of the Digital Revolution exhibition.</p>
</section>


<section>
<p>I was brought on to the project to develop the dynamic audio of the piece with the
    team at FIELD. This involved remixing original material from John Cale, including
    bespoke work from BXFTYS, and setting it all in a constantly changing, immersive 3D
    sonic landscape.</p>

<p>Spot sound effects are triggered by different locations within the environment, and
    the sounds of drones as they fly past are processed using the WebAudio HRTF panner
    to accurately position the sounds in 3D space.</p>

<p>The background music layer and ambience also change as you fly through the different
    areas.

    In addition, I also contributed to the physics of the drones, giving them some
    freedom of movement as they fly around the space, avoiding buildings and each other,
    plus I developed the on-screen HUD graphics and animation.</p>

        in West London, The Virtual Guru is a piece of educational
        software that guides the user through a number of classical
        Indian raags. The user can first listen to the melody, and
        then attempt to recreate it with or without musical
        accompaniment. Their performance is indicated on the screen by
        a continuous line showing their pitch, overlaid upon a similar
        line showing the correct or “guru's” performance.

        RAVE allows VJs, conference graphics operators, editors and
        other video professionals a unique method of editing and
        displaying video content live, in real-time.
    </p>

    <p>
        Using a networked system of ordinary PCs, the user can create
        frame-accurate sequences from existing source material,
        combine them with other clips or sequences, then instantly
        assign them for playback on any or all of the attached
        machines.
    </p>

    <p>
        The interface is multitouch-compatible, which required (in the
        pre-Windows 7 world) re-writing the standard Windows input API
        to take advantage of the additional input.
    </p>

    <p>
        Concept, interface design, video playback engine and
        networking were created specifically for the project.

        Shot over 8 days in the Surrey Hills, this collaboration
        between first-time director and Leigh Dovey and producer Colin

        harvesttime with the savage and the supernatural. The film was
        snapped up for international distribution shortly after

        I was tasked with building 22 interactive 'tables' for
        Hitachi's high-profile 'Inspire Life' event in London & Paris.
    </p>
    <p>
        tables allowed people to explore Hitachi's products and
        services using a unique 3D 'rubix cube' interface.
    </p>
    <p>
        The interfaces would also have to be multitouch, so that a
        'spread' motion on the surface would explode the cube, showing
        the product headings. Pressing an individual cube would
        display information and images related to that area.
