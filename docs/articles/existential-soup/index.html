	<h4>
		A work-in-progress live audio-visual performance with sound artist Þorsteinn
		Eyfjörð Þórarinsson, premiering at Raflost festival 2023.
	</h4>
	<p>
		It was my first time working together as a duo with Þorsteinn, although we'd
		previously worked together on other projects. Without realising what was
		happening, the ambition of the project grew into an entirely new 40-minute
		audio-visual composition, with new ground being explored on both sides -
		Þorsteinn creating a number of absolute bangers ranging from choral-esque
		laments to infra-bass driven sonic workouts, but always keeping a thread of
		'extreme beauty' throughout.
	</p>
	<p>
		For my part, I was looking to explore more into these LIDAR-inspired point
		cloud structures, especially the way that they can be applied to 3d-rendered
		material to give the feeling of detail and movement, but that only exists in
		the head of the viewer.
	</p>
	<p>
		The entire show was performed live with TouchDesigner and a pair of MIDI
		controllers, with no pre-rendered video used, and only a small amount of
		audio-reactive input from the music. We're hoping to take this show on the
		road to festivals in the near future.
