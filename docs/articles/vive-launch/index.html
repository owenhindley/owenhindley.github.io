    <p>>Get Vive Ready by HTC, Google and B-Reel was a WebGL experience that invites the user
    to test if they are &#8216;Vive&nbsp;Ready&#8217;, to promote the launch of
    HTC&#8217;s Vive VR headset.</p>

    <p>The site uses a mobile device as a controller for the 3D desktop experience, and
    requires you to chop, dodge, swing and shake your way through four challenging
    levels.</p>

<section>
    <p>Users completing all four levels were able to enter a prize draw to win an actual
    Vive headset and controller set.</p>

    <p>The site involves some cutting-edge WebGL and mobile phone interaction, which we
    were happy to see recognised in a number of awards including the FWA&#8217;s site of
    the Month (which followed our project Mmorph&#8217;s award the previous month!)</p>
