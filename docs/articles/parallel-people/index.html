    <p>One day, you wake up and find yourself trapped in a transparent box in a hostile, barren landscape - but it appears you're not alone.</p>
    <p> There is the Caretaker, who says they just want to keep you safe inside this box,
        promising to show you wonders beyond imagining.</p>
        <p> There are the Others, individuals trapped in boxes just as you
        are - some of whom are acting strangely.</p>
        <p> And the Voice in your head - together all of them are talking, acting,
        behaving at odds with one another - so who will you believe?

    <p>Based on my theatre company Huldufugl's international award-winning VR experience 'Kassinn / A Box In The Desert' (one of the world's first experiences of its kind), this show expands the narrative to
        allow five audience members to determine their own story against a barrage of conflicting voices.</p>
    <p>My role on this project was lead developer, director and live show operator, with the concept and script co-created by the whole amazing team.</p>
    <p>The show takes place entirely in VR using the Oculus Quest headset.</p>
