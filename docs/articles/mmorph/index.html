    <p>mmorph is an adventure into new ways of delivering interactive music in the browser
    and beyond.<br/><br/>

A collaboration between global music agency MassiveMusic, Reactify Music, Grotesk,
    Enzien Audio and myself, mmorph is an example of a new workflow which we hope will
    open up many possibilities for interactive audio &#8211; first in the browser, and
    then for games, apps, installations and VR.</p>
<p>The site takes you through an interactive music piece, enabling different musical
    parts, applying realtime effects, composing and looping a top-line synth, and
    creating intense build-ups and drops!</p>

   <p> My role was lead developer on the project, handling the integration of the audio
    code from Reactify &#038; Enzien Audio (who in turn were working with original music
    composed by Massive) with realtime SVG graphics and animations art-directed by
    Grotesk.</p>

<p>The interactive audio was produced via a unique workflow where Reactify worked
    rapidly and closely with Massive&#8217;s in-house composer in Pure Data, an visual
    programming environment that allows for real-time prototyping and development.</p>

<p>This Pure Data &#8216;patch&#8217; was then converted to run in the browser via
    Enzien Audio&#8217;s <strong>Heavy</strong> compiler. This compiler can also
    transform the same source patch into code suitable for Unity, Unreal engine,
    OpenFrameworks, desktop/mobile apps and VR experiences, with little or no
    alterations to the original.</p>
