    <p>PONG is a massive interactive outdoor artwork that allows two people to play the
    classic game against each other on the monumental facade of Harpa, Iceland&#8217;s
    flagship concert hall in downtown Reykjavik, designed by Ólafur Eliasson.</p>

<p>Conceived and produced by Atli Bollason, the project began as a chance meeting
    between myself and Atli at a birthday party in Reykjavik, and over the next few
    months developed into a reality &#8211; with not only the CEO of the building coming
    on board very quickly, but for the first time for a project like this, Ólafur
    himself (the first time he has allowed a project like this to take over the
    facade&#8217;s lighting system). Vodafone Iceland also agreed to sponsor the
    project, and supply us with some of the equipment.</p>

<p>The project was launched on Menningarnótt (Culture Night) on the 23rd August 2014,
    and ran for a week afterwards as part of the Reykjavik Dance Festival.
    For the launch night, we setup a stage in front of the building, and players used a
    pair of phones to control their &#8216;paddles&#8217; on the 43m-high screen.
    Afterwards, players were able to join a special Wi-fi network which took them
    directly to the game, which was transmitted from a hill overlooking the building.
    This would allow them to join a virtual queue, and play against friends or complete
    strangers.</p>

<p>Our roles were split with Atli handling the concept, creative direction, project
    management and publicity, and me handling the design, hardware, networking and
    programming.</p>

<p>Three separate Node.js servers run together to create the experience; one running in
    the basement of Harpa which outputs DMX to control the 35&#215;11 pixel display (6
    universes of 512 channels each), one running in the cloud which actually simulates
    the game physics, and receives WebSocket connections from the player&#8217;s phone,
    and another which handles the game queue.</p>

<p> An HTML5 mobile front-end was also developed to give visual feedback to the player
    of their paddle, and current score.

    The code for the entire project is available on <a href="https://github.com/owenhindley/harpapong"> github</a>.</p>
