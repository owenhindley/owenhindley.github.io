		Nine looping 4K video artworks, as part of a group show inspired by Vil√©m
		Flusser's 1985 work of the same name.
	</h4>
    <p>
		I was thrilled to be invited to participate in Reykjav√≠k Design March 2023
		as part of one of Iceland's first group shows exhibiting digital artists on
		9 huge 4K displays.

    <p>
		Curated by Nils Wiberg, the theme of the exhibition comes from Vil√©m
		Flusser's philosophical work which describes the concept of Technical
		Images, an abstraction above film, video, text and drawings, that describe
		and convey concepts in ways that the previous mediums cannot.

		He goes on to describe a possible future in which we're all co-creating
		these images together in 'darkened rooms' - a chamber orchestra that jointly
		maps reality, and that distribution of the means of production of these
		images could help lead us to a utopic understanding of the world, but also
		warns that centralised control and censorship of these images would lead to
		deep repression and a dystopic future. For me the text, if you squint a bit,
		gives a really poetic and prescient way of visualising our current media
		landscape, from the co-created, mass-consumed reality of Instagram and
		TikTok, to the state-level media control in countries such as China and
		Russia.

		The pieces were inspired by the LIDAR work I've been doing with Volta and
		Aristokrasia, made in Unity, with big thanks to Parik Ontkovic for
		camerawork, Liam Cobb, Uta Reichardt, √çris Erlings Ren√© Boonekamp and
		Hafnarhaus for the recording test process.
