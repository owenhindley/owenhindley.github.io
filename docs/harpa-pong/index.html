		PONG is a massive interactive outdoor artwork that allows two people to play
		the classic game against each other on the monumental facade of Harpa,
		Iceland&#8217;s flagship concert hall in downtown Reykjavik, designed by
		Ã“lafur Eliasson.
	</p>

	<p>
		Conceived and produced by Atli Bollason, the project began as a chance
		meeting between myself and Atli at a birthday party in Reykjavik, and over
		the next few months developed into a reality &#8211; with not only the CEO
		of the building coming on board very quickly, but for the first time for a
		project like this, Ã“lafur himself (the first time he has allowed a project
		like this to take over the facade&#8217;s lighting system). Vodafone Iceland
		also agreed to sponsor the project, and supply us with some of the
		equipment.
	</p>

		The project was launched on MenningarnÃ³tt (Culture Night) on the 23rd August
		2014, and ran for a week afterwards as part of the Reykjavik Dance Festival.
		For the launch night, we setup a stage in front of the building, and players
		used a pair of phones to control their &#8216;paddles&#8217; on the 43m-high
		screen. Afterwards, players were able to join a special Wi-fi network which
		took them directly to the game, which was transmitted from a hill
		overlooking the building. This would allow them to join a virtual queue, and
		play against friends or complete strangers.

		Our roles were split with Atli handling the concept, creative direction,
		project management and publicity, and me handling the design, hardware,
		networking and programming.
	</p>

	<p>
		Three separate Node.js servers run together to create the experience; one
		running in the basement of Harpa which outputs DMX to control the 35&#215;11
		pixel display (6 universes of 512 channels each), one running in the cloud
		which actually simulates the game physics, and receives WebSocket
		connections from the player&#8217;s phone, and another which handles the
		game queue.
	</p>

	<p>
		An HTML5 mobile front-end was also developed to give visual feedback to the
		player of their paddle, and current score. The code for the entire project
		is available on
		<a href="https://github.com/owenhindley/harpapong"> github</a>.
