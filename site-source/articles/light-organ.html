        For a few days in February 2016, visitors of Harpa Music Hall in Reykjavík were
        invited to play the façade of the building as they would an instrument. A
        &#8220;light organ&#8221; was placed on the 4th floor balcony, with a stunning view
        of the inside of the geometrical glass front and the downtown
        area.Anyone who passed through could learn how to play in blue or red or
        green, with quick flashes or swelling pads of light, and impress the whole city with
        an optical performance.
