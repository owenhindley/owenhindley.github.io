                HARMONY IS COLOUR.<br/>
                PITCH IS POSITION.<br/>
                STRENGTH IS BRILLIANCE.<br/>
        </strong></p>
        <p>For a few days in February 2016, visitors of Harpa Music Hall in Reykjavík were
                invited to play the façade of the building as they would an instrument. A
                &#8220;light organ&#8221; was placed on the 4th floor balcony, with a stunning view
                of the inside of the geometrical glass front and the downtown
                area.
        </p>
        <p>Anyone who passed through could learn how to play in blue or red or
                green, with quick flashes or swelling pads of light, and impress the whole city with
                an optical performance.</p>
