    <p>Resonate is a festival that brings together artists to drive a forward-looking
    debate on the position of technology in art and culture.</p>
<p>Held annually in Belgrade, Serbia, it draws visual artists, programmers, performers,
    musicians and curators to present and discuss their work, share new ideas, work, knowledge and plum brandy.</p>
    <!-- The graphic identity for the 2015 festival was developed by the Resonate team and FIELD.io, and is described as NEON TRIBAL PLAYGROUND CULTURE - and it informed the direction for all graphic, web and motion design relating to the festival.-->

<p>For the trailer, FIELD collaborated with director / designer Antar Walker to bring
    their graphic identity for the festival into motion.</p>

<p> I was approached by FIELD to collaborate with the team on the musical score and
    sound design for the piece.
    <!-- The brief was to produce something as playful, human, optimistic but still contemporary as the identity itself, incorporating tribal sounds and percussion whilst still retaining an air of exploration and ambition.-->

    I immediately brought my long-suffering friend and collaborator Ragnar Hrafnkelsson
    on board, and together we composed, mixed and mastered the final soundtrack.</p>

<p>In addition to receiving considerable coverage online, the trailer was also aired on
    Serbian national TV in the run-up to the festival opening.</p>
