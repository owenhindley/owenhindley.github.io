	<h3>A short story about a Surveyor, surveying a strange Land.</h3>

    <p>
		This piece of semi-automatic/interactive fiction was written between late 2023 and
		mid-2024, after I'd been living in Iceland for over seven years. If you
		like, it's also about the UK (my home country), and if you like even more,
		it can be about your own.

		You can read the entire thing on itch.io at the link below. The average
		reading time is between 30 minutes to an hour, depending on how fast you go.
