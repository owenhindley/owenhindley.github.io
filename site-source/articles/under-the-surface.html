		An interactive spatial data experience by Field.io studio for IBM Randori,
		allowing you to see through the eyes of a hacker.

		An adventure into spatial data visualisation, Field.io contacted me to help
		them out with the task of developing an interactive system that visualises
		real attack surface data from a hacker's point of view.
	</p>
	<p>
		This tool would travel to digital security conferences all over the world,
		and win multiple awards allowing IBM to explain their Randori product to
		their customers in a dynamic and immersive way.

		I brought my good friend PÃ¡ll PÃ¡lsson along for the journey into Unity-based
		compute shader wonderland, and together with Claus Helfenschneider and Seph
		Li we developed a data sculpture that the user could zoom through using Leap
		Motion-powered gestures, and would transform to show different aspects of
		the data, all controlled via Claus' excellent MQTT-based system for the SME
		to use whilst on-site.
