    <p>So I&#8217;ve been a massive fan of Universal Everything&#8217;s work ever since
        Matt Pyke formed the studio post-Designers Republic, so being invited to join them
        as a developer on this adventure was a bit exciting, to say the least!
    </p>
    <p>
        The brief was to produce a real-time, interactive artwork that would be projected
        onto seven monumental &#8216;petals&#8217;, designed and inhabiting a space by Zaha
        Hadid Architects, within a relatively short timeframe &#8211; and with a lot of
        press attention on the final result, so no small order.</p>

        With a tight timeline, the lead developer Chris Mullany and I developed a system for
        simulating choreographed bird-like motion onto thousands of unique
        &#8216;avatars&#8217; &#8211; playful, generative striped characters who would fly
        and dance around the space.</p>
    <p>We worked rapidly in Unity, with Chris handling the creation and rendering of the
        Avatars, and me handling the flocking motion and choreographies that would play in
        synchronicity with composed music from Simon Pyke / Freefarm.</p>
    <p>The final setup in Milan required an impressive assortment of hardware, handled by
        an amazing crew of projectionists, d3 operators, sound and lighting designers, and
        our playback rig &#8211; 6 high-end PCs running Unity apps, all synchronised via
        network from a single server, from which we could adjust and refine all aspects of
        the show once we arrived in Milan.</p>
