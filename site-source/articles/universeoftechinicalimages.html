    <h4>
        Nine looping 4K video artworks, as part of a group show
        inspired by Vilém Flusser's 1985 work of the same name.

        I was thrilled to be invited to participate in Reykjavík
        Design March 2023 as part of one of Iceland's first group
        shows exhibiting digital artists on 9 huge 4K displays.

        Curated by Nils Wiberg, the theme of the exhibition comes from
        Vilém Flusser's philosophical work which describes the concept
        of Technical Images, an abstraction above film, video, text
        and drawings, that describe and convey concepts in ways that
        the previous mediums cannot.

        He goes on to describe a possible future in which we're all
        co-creating these images together in 'darkened rooms' - a
        chamber orchestra that jointly maps reality, and that
        distribution of the means of production of these images could
        help lead us to a utopic understanding of the world, but also
        warns that centralised control and censorship of these images
        would lead to deep repression and a dystopic future. For me
        the text, if you squint a bit, gives a really poetic and
        prescient way of visualising our current media landscape, from
        the co-created, mass-consumed reality of Instagram and TikTok,
        to the state-level media control in countries such as China
        and Russia.

        The pieces were inspired by the LIDAR work I've been doing
        with Volta and Aristokrasia, made in Unity, with big thanks to
        Parik Ontkovic for camerawork, Liam Cobb, Uta Reichardt, Íris
        Erlings René Boonekamp and Hafnarhaus for the recording test
        process.
