        <p>One of the world's first pieces of its kind, the show explores what happens by smashing together
                future-thinking theatre forms
                with technology.</p>
        <p>Created by Huldufugl (an Icelandic / British events company co-founded by myself and
                writer, actress &amp; producer Nanna Gunnars), the piece is a mix of Virtual Reality, mutliplayer
                gaming and interactive theatre.</p>
        <p>The concept initially began as a short play by Nanna, written and performed in a
                conventional theatre in 2016 &#8211; after which I put forward the idea to re-create
                this piece in VR. We premiered the first version in Reykjavík in August 2017, and
                developed it for a longer run in July 2018, before taking the show to the Stockholm
                Fringe Festival in September 2018, and with more international dates planned for
                2019!</p>
        <p>One person at a time experiences the piece inside of a 2 x 2m physical space, whilst
                the actor performs in a separate physical space. For our first outing, we used the
                Xsens motion capture suit (expertly handled by <a href="http://puppit.is" target="_blank">PuppIT</a>),
                but currently the show involves two Oculus Rift setups, sharing the same virtual space using multiplayer networking.</p>
        <p>Show control is handled by an operator, who can observe and control both events in
                the world and the &#8216;voice in your head&#8217; via a Qlab interface, and we have
                a beautiful LED box created by Swedish engineering magicians <a href="http://svartljus.se"
                        target="_blank">Svartljus</a></p>
        <p>After touring the piece throughout Europe and to the USA, we went back into the rehearsal room to re-create
                the experience for more than one audience member at a time. The result is Hliðstætt Fólk / Parallel
                People, which you can read more about above.</p>
