        <h4>A short platform experience about using the wind to guide your way.</h4>
</section>
<section>
        <p>Originally created for the Isle of Games 002 (see isleofgames.is) exhibition on the
                theme of &#8220;The Tempest&#8221;, the player is making their way through a pitch
                black world, with nothing but the wind to guide their path.</p>
        <p>The installation version was for two people to cooperate, one using a joystick to
                control the character, the other using rotating lava rock + button to control the
                wind. This version is just controlled using the keyboard.</p>
