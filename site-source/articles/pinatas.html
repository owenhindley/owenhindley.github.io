<p>International agency Isobar collaborated with B-Reel and Groovy Gecko to create a
    live, web-connected experience that allowed users to smash a real-life piñata using
    a robotic arm, in order to promote the new flavours of Pringles
    Tortillas.</p>
<p>Users in the UK and Germany were able to sign up via Twitter and/or Facebook to take
    a hit at the unlucky piñata, successful entrants would win a Tortillas-related
    prize!</p>

<p>B-Reel approached me to lead the design and build of the robotic arm &#8211; a
    really fun challenge!</p>
<p>This required a lot of research into fabrication methods, and learning about
    pneumatics for the first time, combined with electronic control (via <a href="http://www.phidgets.com/"
        target="_blank">Phidgets</a>) and backend
    development to connect the entire system to the website (being developed by
    Isobar)</p>
<p>After constructing two beautiful robots (Pedro &#038; Mario, in reserve), we to work
    smashing piñatas, the arm pounding each one with 20psi of force per hit. Over 40
    piñatas a day were obliterated live online, in a custom-built Mexican marketplace
    set deep within East London.</p>
