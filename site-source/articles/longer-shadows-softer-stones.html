		My good friend and all-round wonderful human Antje invited me to collaborate on a series of music videos for the equally marvellous Snorri Hallgrímsson, who was in the process of preparing for his release of 'Longer Shadows, Softer Stones' on Deutsche Grammophon.
	</p>
	<p>We developed three creative concepts for the lead singles on the album, 'With Love, Despite The Pain', 'And I Alone', and 'Hinum megin', with Antje behind the lens, minimal lighting, but extensive use of my depth-scatter projection techniques to give an ethereal, floating look to match Antje's incredible eye for unexpected but beautiful angles and composition.</p>
	<p>
		After two intense days of experimental filming, projection, shadow-work, we sent the footage off to superstar editors (and director) Guy Davidi &amp; Maja Friis, and we were delighted with the results.

		On top of all that, in early 2025 we were delighted to discover that we had been nominated for Music Video Of The Year at the Icelandic Music Awards, up against some stiff competition and amazing work. Sadly we didn't win, but it was wonderful to see the piece getting recognition in the wider Icelandic music scene.
