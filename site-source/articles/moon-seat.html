    <p>The Moon Seat is a playful installation that entertains our inner child whilst
    simultaneously courting long forgotten childhood fears.

    The installation had its first public outing at the <strong>e-Luminate</strong>
    festival in Cambridge, UK from 12th-17th February 2016, and was located on the front
    lawn of the prestigious Cambridge Union Society.</p>

    <p>Audience members were invited to sit, at which point the pool of moonlight would
    instantly open to show their shadow. After a few seconds, their shadow would
    transform into an animal controlled by their bodily movements, but
    with a character all of its own. An ethereal generative soundtrack reacting to the
    user's movements accompanies the piece.</p>

    <p>I'd worked with Alex for a long time at B-Reel, and I was very excited to be
    asked to get involved in his first independent installation art piece!

    It quickly became apparent that we were going to need some more help, so we drafted
    in ex-B-Reelers and good friends Yi-Wen Lin and Christian Persson to come on board.</p>

    <p>We pulled in quite a variety of technologies for this one, including <a href="http://processing.org"
        target="_blank">Processing</a> (main show), <a href="http://nwjs.io" target="_blank">NodeWebkit</a> (gesture
    detection &amp;
    tracking), <a href="http://labs.adobe.com/technologies/flashruntimes/" target="_blank">Flash/AIR</a> (character
    animation &amp; playback) and <a href="http://puredata.info/" target="_blank">Pure Data</a> (generative audio
   &amp; DMX control)</p>
