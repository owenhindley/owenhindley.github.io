    <p>A collaboration between Hikapee Theatre and Huldufugl, The Hidden People is a show for medium to large stages
        (500 capacity+) that combines Icelandic folklore, circus/ aerial arts, performance and creative technology.</p>
    <p>Our story concerns the Hidden People, beings of uncertain benevolence often held responsible in Icelandic stories
        for both sudden good fortune and disappearances, unexpected occurrences and madness.</p>
    <p>We are using these tales to present modern environmental issues, specifically the building of hydroelectric dams
        in Iceland.</p>

    <p>Hikapee approached us at Huldufugl to collaborate on this piece, and for us to join our skills with creative
        technology to their high-flying aerial storytelling abilities.</p>
    <p>During the research and development process, we experimented with different technologies to animate this world -
        and settled on large-scale projection mapping, using both the set and the performers themselves as a canvas</p>
    <p>We ended up having projected visuals for the entire duration of the show (90 minutes). I used Houdini and Unity
        to model and render the scenes, working in realtime during rehearsals, then rendering out high-resolution HAP
        video for playback in most cases, with a few scenes exported as live Unity apps, controlled with an Xbox gamepad
        live during shows, which is still a little nerve-racking!</p>
    <p>Playback was handled using a large custom-made TouchDesigner setup, responding to OSC from Qlab, and handling
        realtime post-effects such as ripples, and mapping the two projectors onto the stage.</p>
    <p>Finally, after several years of rehearsals, covid-induced delays and fundraising, the world premiere took place
        at Worthing Pavilion Theatre in March 2022. The show plans to be touring worldwide from August 2022.</p>
