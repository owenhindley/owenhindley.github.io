    <h4>A collaboration between Hikapee Theatre and Huldufugl,  a show for medium to large stages
        that combines Icelandic folklore, circus arts, theatre and creative technology.</h4>

<!-- <section>
    <p>Our story concerns the Hidden People, beings of uncertain benevolence often held responsible in Icelandic stories
        for both sudden good fortune and disappearances, unexpected occurrences and madness.</p>
    <p>We are using these tales to present modern environmental issues, specifically the building of hydroelectric dams
        in Iceland.</p>

    <!-- <p>Hikapee approached us at Huldufugl to collaborate on this piece, and for us to join our skills with creative
        technology to their high-flying aerial storytelling abilities.</p>
    <p>During the research and development process, we experimented with different technologies to animate this world -
        and settled on large-scale projection mapping, using both the set and the performers themselves as a canvas</p> -->
    <p>With projected visuals for the entire duration of the show (90 minutes). I used Houdini and Unity
        to model and render the scenes, working in realtime during rehearsals, then rendering out high-resolution HAP
        video.</p> 
    <p>Playback was handled using a custom-made TouchDesigner app, receiving cues via OSC from Qlab, running
        realtime effects on top of the video, and handling the projection mapping.</p>
      <p> Whilst most of the scenes are purely video playback in most cases, with a few scenes are exported as live Unity apps, controlled with an Xbox gamepad
        live during shows, which just to keep things exciting!</p>
    <p>Finally, after several years of rehearsals, covid-induced delays and fundraising, the world premiere took place
        at Worthing Pavilion Theatre in March 2022. The show plans to be touring worldwide from August 2022.</p>
