		"My body started foaming. Foam came out of my eyes, my ears, armpits, crotch. My memories seeped through the skin. My voice evaporated like steam from the ground. And now I am here"

    <h4>Sérstæðan is an interdisciplinary dance performance where choreography, poetry, music, and scenography merge into one. It tells the story of a future being who has shed her physical form and now exists only in the digital realm.</h4>

		Sérstæðan is born from the idea of the technological singularity, a proposed moment in future when technology grows beyond human control. The show delves into profound questions about existence without a body, the absence of physical sensations, and the future of dance when the body is gone. The stage itself — sound, light, projection, water, and smoke—become the central performers, while the audience's presence sustains these imagined worlds.

    <p>I was thrilled to be invited onboard the project, to work with visual artists Katarina Blahutova and Sean Patrik O'Brien in creating this spectacular show.</p>
    <p>Under the direction of Rósa Ómarsdottír, and with the performer/singer Inga Huld Hákonardóttir, we together created a 90-minute spectacular of movement, sound, light, water, foam, fog, mist, rain, waves, air, refraction, materials and bodies.</p>
    <p>And it was also great to work again with Sveinbjörn Thorarensen (Hermigervill), who I haven't worked with since our Out Of Sync project during Covid.</p>
    <p>It's been one of the most technically ambitious stage projects I've been a part of, and thanks to the amazing team we pulled it off!</p>

    <p>My role mainly included TouchDesigner, Qlab and GrandMA3 programming, giving us a mix of live control and pre-choreographed timelines across motors, pumps, fans, lights and sound.</p>
    <p>The show premiered in Tjarnarbíó in November 2025, and is planned to tour in 2026.</p>
