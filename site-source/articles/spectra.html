    <p>Spectra 2, a mesmerising kinetic sculpture by FIELD.io in collaboration with design
    studio Accept &#038; Proceed was displayed in the studio&#8217;s East London gallery
    space in Summer 2014.</p>
<p>The piece consists of suspended polished steel segments, controlled by stepper
    motors &#038; custom electronics, that form rippling terrains inspired by NASA lunar
    meteor impact data.</p>

    <p>Collaborating with lead engineer Laurence Symonds, FIELD and A&#038;P, I was
    responsible for the design &#038; implementation of the motor software control
    system, which played back a pre-choreographed sequence (pre-visualised and designed
    in Houdini by FIELD).
    I was also very happy to be part of the superhuman build, test &#038;
    installation team.</p>

<p>Custom Arduino firmware and a unique serial protocol needed to be developed in order
    to synchronise movement across all 48 motors for the duration of the hour-plus long
    sequence. A Node.js server was written to handle playback and synchronisation with a
    wall-mounted display, and triggering of audio samples via OSC.</p>
