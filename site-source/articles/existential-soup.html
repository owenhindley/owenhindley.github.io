	<h4>
		A live audio-visual band with sound artist √ûorsteinn Eyfj√∂r√∞ √û√≥rarinsson.
	</h4>
	<p>
		√ûorsteinn and I started MOTET with the idea of producing audio-visual work
		in the same way a band produces music, with both elements being influenced
		by each other, produced and then performed simultaneously.
	</p>
	<p>
		As a live act, we perform together as live as possible, with everything
		running real-time and being controlled by actual fingers on controllers as
		much as humanly possible (although sometimes I run out of fingers).
	</p>
	<p>
		We make pieces that are at times aggressive and dystopic, but at the same
		time with a note of hope, and sometimes beautiful, with a note of despair.
		We're inspired by literature, nature, late-night YouTube rabbitholes, and
		the artists that have shaped our audio-visual sensibilities over the years.
	</p>
	<p>Our first EP is being released via our good friends at INNI Music.</p>
