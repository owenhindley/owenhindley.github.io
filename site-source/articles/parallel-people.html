    <p>One day, you wake up and find yourself trapped in a transparent box in a hostile, barren landscape. It appears
        that you're not alone. There is the Caretaker, who says they just want to keep you safe inside this box,
        promising to show you wonders beyond imagining. There are the Others, individuals trapped in boxes just as you
        are - some of whom are acting strangely. And the Voice in your head - together all of them are talking, acting,
        behaving at odds with one another - so who will you believe?

    <p class="small">Parallel People is a light-hearted interactive group VR show by Huldufugl. Based on their
        international award-winning solo VR experience 'Kassinn / A Box In The Desert', it expands the narrative to
        allow five audience members to determine their own story against a barrage of conflicting voices.</p>
    <p class="small">The show takes place entirely in VR using the Oculus Quest headset.</p>
