    Horizons is a series of interactive VR music journeys for
    Google Daydream, available for free on the Play Store.

    After a chance introduction in Iceland via the wonderful people at <a
        href="http://www.bedroomcommunity.net/">Bedroom Community</a>, I was invited to
    submit a proposal for a launch title for Google&#8217;s new VR headset, Daydream. I
    contacted my long-term collaborator Yuli Levtov and together with our friends David
    Li and Leif Podhajsky, we laid out plans to create the first music-focused title for
    this new platform.

    After launch, in collaboration with Ninja Tune heavyweight artist
    Bonobo, the Horizons team (Yuli Levtov, David Li, Leif Podhajsky and myself) saddled up again to
    create a brand new psychedelic interactive music journey for the Horizons platform
    on Google Daydream.

    The new scene features the track Outlier from his latest album Migration, and allows
    you to deeply interact with the music, which in turn has an effect on the landscape
    you fly through. Flocks of birds join you on your journey through sand dunes,
    towering mountains and beneath the waves.

<section>Within the app, you control the music &#8211; the music
    controls the world. You can use the Daydream controller to make an otherworldly
    jungle come alive with sound, or travel at breakneck speed through colourful
    hyperspace.


    In December 2016 we launched the first two scenes, featuring great music from both
    My Panda Shall Fly and Reuben Cainer. We&#8217;re very excited to be launching the
    third scene in early 2017, and there&#8217;s more to come.
