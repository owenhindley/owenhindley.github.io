    <p>&#8216;The Glitch&#8217; was a highly secretive and unusual campaign launched by
    Microsoft, CP+B and B-Reel that took players on a journey across the Internet,
    challenging them to solve puzzles and crack codes to win a mysterious
    prize.</p>
<p>This formed part of the UK XBox One launch, and part of Microsoft&#8217;s effort to
    engage directly with hardcore gamers by working on their level.
    The glitch took the form of a 1 second &#8216;disruption&#8217; to the Xbox TV
    collaboration that had already been on regular rotation on UK TV channels for some
    time. Hidden within this were a number of codes and clues that would set players off
    on their journey.</p>

<p>I headed up the development side of the project team at B-Reel, and was responsible
    for laying out this network of cryptic sites across the web in such a way as to give
    no clue as to who, or what was behind the Glitch.</p>
<p>A sophisticated PHP backend system was built to monitor and control all the various
    endpoints to allow tracking of players as they moved through the contest, and
    shutting off routes as soon as prizes had been awarded.</p>
<p>In addition, I was also responsible for the glitched-up sound design across all of
    the routes, which added to the air of mystery and suspense surrounding the
    campaign.</p>
