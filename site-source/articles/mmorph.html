    mmorph is an adventure into new ways of delivering interactive music in the browser
    and beyond.

    A collaboration between global music agency MassiveMusic, Reactify Music, Grotesk,
    Enzien Audio and myself, mmorph is an example of a new workflow which we hope will
    open up many possibilities for interactive audio &#8211; first in the browser, and
    then for games, apps, installations and VR.
    The site takes you through an interactive music piece, enabling different musical
    parts, applying realtime effects, composing and looping a top-line synth, and
    creating intense build-ups and drops!

    My role was lead developer on the project, handling the integration of the audio
    code from Reactify &#038; Enzien Audio (who in turn were working with original music
    composed by Massive) with realtime SVG graphics and animations art-directed by
    Grotesk.

    The interactive audio was produced via a unique workflow where Reactify worked
    rapidly and closely with Massive&#8217;s in-house composer in Pure Data, an visual
    programming environment that allows for real-time prototyping and development.

    This Pure Data &#8216;patch&#8217; was then converted to run in the browser via
    Enzien Audio&#8217;s <strong>Heavy</strong> compiler. This compiler can also
    transform the same source patch into code suitable for Unity, Unreal engine,
    OpenFrameworks, desktop/mobile apps and VR experiences, with little or no
    alterations to the original.
