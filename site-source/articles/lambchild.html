    <p> In 2017, my studio Horizons (with co-founders Yuli Levtov and David Li) was approached by Chris Milk and
        Aaron Koblin's VR powerhouse Within to help them develop an incredibly ambitious VR project in collaboration
        with Oculus Studios, and the musical / creative force of OKGO.</p>
    <p>The task was to create an experience in VR where the user could produce their very own pop song,
        complete with drums, bass, guitar, synth, vocals (recorded and auto-tuned by the user) and a special cow-based
        freestyle solo instrument.</p>
    <p>The final piece includes a staggering amount of layers of animation, machine learning, audio
        analysis and processing, a custom sound engine, VR interaction and musical theory.</p>

    <p>In 2018 we were very excited to give the world a peek of the final piece, at both Tribeca Film Festival and
        Sonar+ in Barcelona.</p>
    <p>Two audience members at a time, carefully guided by white-coated docents, could collaborate on building a song
        together in a purpose-built booth. The piece attracted a significant amount of positive attention, being
        described as 'Social VR's Rock Band' by Wired, and others.</p>
    <p>My role as lead developer ranged from prototyping musical interaction concepts at the start of the project, to
        co-ordinating the fantastic development team across several different cities and time zones, overseeing the
        asset pipeline of animated creatures from the art team into Unity, and working directly on various parts of the
        project.</p>
    <p>We're excited for the final public release of the project, to see the music people make in the Menagerie of the
        Holy Cow!</p>
