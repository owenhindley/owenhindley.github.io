    <!-- <p>This short film in VR is an spin-off project from Huldufugl and Hikapee's (equally ambitious) stage show, The
        Hidden People, after that project was delayed by a year due to the pandemic.</p>
    <p>We've been collaborating with UK aerial circus company Hikapee since 2018 on a large-scale stage production - but
        when it became apparent that we were going to have to pause work on it for at least a year, we came up with the
        idea of producing an animated VR short film using the same performers, set in the same world, but with a brand
        new storyline.</p>
    <p>The first step was to find a motion capture company brave enough to work with tumbling, spinning circus
        performers using silks, trapeze and counterbalancing equipment - a real challenge for the tracking system - and
        then do the entire thing on location, whilst adhering to strict COVID-19 safety measures.</p>
    <p>We were extremely lucky to find a partner in Target3D, who sent an incredible crew to join our artists in
        isolation at 101 Outdoor Arts in Newbury for a week. Under Bryony from Hikapee's direction, they recorded an
        entire narrative of aerial circus-infused action.</p>
    <p>The film is currently under production with all the virtual sets, characters, lighting and composition currently
        under way.</p>
    <p>It's a unique challenge to produce animated work for VR - where almost anything is possible in terms of angles,
        lighting, sound and set design. For our piece, we're taking a lot of cues from theatre over film in terms of set
        layout and the audience's relationship to the performers - but this still leaves us a huge possibility space to
        play with, which is extremely exciting!</p>
    <p>We're also aiming for a unique art style that represents the Icelandic nature - acheived through procedural
        modelling in Houdini, taking the rough outlines of landscapes, and 'shredding' them into thousands of small,
        individually coloured polygons. This approach retains sharp edges in VR even up-close, without using textures,
        whilst also giving us fine control over colour, pre-baked static lighting, and vertex shader effects like wind
        movement in trees, water and moss.</p> -->
    <p>
        Work in progress! Upon release, the piece will be available
        for Oculus Quest and other major VR platforms.
