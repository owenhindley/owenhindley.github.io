        Directed by Colin Arnold at The Surgery Productions,
        Subsource: A Dubumentary follows UK band Subsource on tour
        across the UK and Europe, giving a unique insight into what it
        means to be making it as a touring, gigging group of musicians
        in 2011.

        The film was toured around film festivals in Europe and the
        UK. I was brought in to mix and edit the audio in
        post-production for cinema release.
