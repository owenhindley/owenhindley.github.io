        I managed and performed with 'You Heard Nothing', a group of
        DJs, VJs, designers and filmakers based in Guildford, Surrey.
        We reguarly played nights around the Surrey and London areas,
        having supported acts such as Mary Anne Hobbs, Zane Lowe, The
        Freestylers and Pendulum. We held a monthly residency at The
        Boileroom, Guildford.

        I wanted to produce a video that illsutrated in an interesting
        way the sensation of a night out at You Heard Nothing, and
        came up with the concept for this video 'Last Night'. Shot
        over a weekend in Guildford, it follows the series of
        trailers, interviews and ident that can be seen on our
        website.
