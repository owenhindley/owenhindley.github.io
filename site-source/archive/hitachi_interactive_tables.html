        I was tasked with building 22 interactive 'tables' for
        Hitachi's high-profile 'Inspire Life' event in London & Paris.
    </p>
    <p>
        tables allowed people to explore Hitachi's products and
        services using a unique 3D 'rubix cube' interface.
    </p>
    <p>
        The interfaces would also have to be multitouch, so that a
        'spread' motion on the surface would explode the cube, showing
        the product headings. Pressing an individual cube would
        display information and images related to that area.
