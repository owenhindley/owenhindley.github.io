    <p>
        Chrome Web Lab is a series of interactive experiments by
        Google Creative Labs, accessible both throughout the world,
        and at the Science Museum, London.

    <p>
        The aim was to bring the magic of the web to life, both online
        and in the physical world.

    <p>
        As part of the development team at B-Reel, I was responsible
        for aspects of the front-end development across the entire
        site.
    </p>

    <p>
        This involved cutting-edge HTML5 development, tight
        integration with a complex-back-end system, real-time
        interaction via WebSockets, all in collaboration with the
        talented team at B-Reel, as well as Tellart and Google.
