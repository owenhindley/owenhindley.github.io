        Created by Flaming Pear Interactive for two new exhibits at
        Madame Tussaud's London and Madame Tussaud's Berlin, an
        interactive karaoke system was created that allows you to sing
        along with hits by Zac Efron, Miley Cyrus and The Jonas
        Brothers (London version), and Take That, Madonna, Beyonce and
        Michael Jackson (Berlin version)
    </p>

    <p>
        The interactives consisted of a touchscreen kiosk plus
        microphone, and displayed the user's sung pitch continually
        against that of the original vocal, with animated graphical
        feedback to let the user know how they performed.

        I was responsible for the development & installation of the
        two interactives, both in London & liasing with on-site staff
        in Berlin.
