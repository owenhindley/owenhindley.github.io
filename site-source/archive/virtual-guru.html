        Created by Flaming Pear Interactive for the Asian Music Centre
        in West London, The Virtual Guru is a piece of educational
        software that guides the user through a number of classical
        Indian raags. The user can first listen to the melody, and
        then attempt to recreate it with or without musical
        accompaniment. Their performance is indicated on the screen by
        a continuous line showing their pitch, overlaid upon a similar
        line showing the correct or “guru's” performance.

        I was tasked with the development and installation of the
        software, in time for the visit by HRH The Prince of Wales,
        which made the headlines.
