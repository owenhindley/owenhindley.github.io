        A short platform experience about using the wind to guide your way.
        Originally created for the Isle of Games 002 (see isleofgames.is) exhibition on the
        theme of &#8220;The Tempest&#8221;, the player is making their way through a pitch
        black world, with nothing but the wind to guide their path.
        The installation version was for two people to cooperate, one using a joystick to
        control the character, the other using rotating lava rock + button to control the
        wind. This version is just controlled using the keyboard.
