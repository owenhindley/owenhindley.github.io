    <p><em>Imagine one day, you wake up inside an invisible box, unable to escape. Kassinn
            is an engaging, but playful, interactive theatre performance with a live actor
            in virtual reality. Will you trust this mysterious stranger? Or listen to the
            voice in your head, trying to get you out?</em></p>
    <p>Created by Huldufugl (an Icelandic / British events company co-founded by myself and
        writer, actress &amp; producer Nanna Gunnars), the show explores what I&#8217;ve
        been wanting to do for a long time, smashing together future-thinking theatre forms
        with technology &#8211; in this case, Virtual Reality and mutliplayer
        gaming!</p>

    The concept initially began as a short play by Nanna, written and performed in a
    conventional theatre in 2016 &#8211; after which I put forward the idea to re-create
    this piece in VR. We premiered the first version in Reykjavík in August 2017, and
    developed it for a longer run in July 2018, before taking the show to the Stockholm
    Fringe Festival in September 2018, and with more international dates planned for
    2019!
    One person at a time experiences the piece inside of a 2 x 2m physical space, whilst
    the actor performs in a separate physical space. For our first outing, we used the
    Xsens motion capture suit (expertly handled by <a href="http://puppit.is" target="_blank">PuppIT</a>), but currently
    the show involves two Oculus Rift
    setups, sharing the same virtual space using multiplayer networking.
    Show control is handled by an operator, who can observe and control both events in
    the world and the &#8216;voice in your head&#8217; via a Qlab interface, and we have
    a beautiful LED box created by Swedish engineering magicians <a href="http://svartljus.se"
