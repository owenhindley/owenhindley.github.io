    <h4>A fantastical journey into the Icelandic highlands and beyond with two escaped convicts and their driver.</h4>
    <h4>Performed by circus artists during lockdown, captured using motion capture technology.</h4>
</section>
<section>
    <!-- <p>This short film in VR is an spin-off project from Huldufugl and Hikapee's (equally ambitious) stage show, The
        Hidden People, after that project was delayed by a year due to the pandemic.</p>
    <p>We've been collaborating with UK aerial circus company Hikapee since 2018 on a large-scale stage production - but
        when it became apparent that we were going to have to pause work on it for at least a year, we came up with the
        idea of producing an animated VR short film using the same performers, set in the same world, but with a brand
        new storyline.</p>
    <p>The first step was to find a motion capture company brave enough to work with tumbling, spinning circus
        performers using silks, trapeze and counterbalancing equipment - a real challenge for the tracking system - and
        then do the entire thing on location, whilst adhering to strict COVID-19 safety measures.</p>
    <p>We were extremely lucky to find a partner in Target3D, who sent an incredible crew to join our artists in
        isolation at 101 Outdoor Arts in Newbury for a week. Under Bryony from Hikapee's direction, they recorded an
        entire narrative of aerial circus-infused action.</p>
    <p>The film is currently under production with all the virtual sets, characters, lighting and composition currently
        under way.</p>
    <p>It's a unique challenge to produce animated work for VR - where almost anything is possible in terms of angles,
        lighting, sound and set design. For our piece, we're taking a lot of cues from theatre over film in terms of set
        layout and the audience's relationship to the performers - but this still leaves us a huge possibility space to
        play with, which is extremely exciting!</p>
    <p>We're also aiming for a unique art style that represents the Icelandic nature - acheived through procedural
        modelling in Houdini, taking the rough outlines of landscapes, and 'shredding' them into thousands of small,
        individually coloured polygons. This approach retains sharp edges in VR even up-close, without using textures,
        whilst also giving us fine control over colour, pre-baked static lighting, and vertex shader effects like wind
        movement in trees, water and moss.</p> -->
    <p>Work in progress! Release is scheduled for early 2023, for Oculus Quest and other major VR platforms.</p>

<!-- <section>
    <p>Our story concerns the Hidden People, beings of uncertain benevolence often held responsible in Icelandic stories
        for both sudden good fortune and disappearances, unexpected occurrences and madness.</p>
    <p>We are using these tales to present modern environmental issues, specifically the building of hydroelectric dams
        in Iceland.</p>
</section> -->
<section>
    <!-- <p>Hikapee approached us at Huldufugl to collaborate on this piece, and for us to join our skills with creative
        technology to their high-flying aerial storytelling abilities.</p>
    <p>During the research and development process, we experimented with different technologies to animate this world -
        and settled on large-scale projection mapping, using both the set and the performers themselves as a canvas</p> -->
    <p>With projected visuals for the entire duration of the show (90 minutes). I used Houdini and Unity
        to model and render the scenes, working in realtime during rehearsals, then rendering out high-resolution HAP
        video for playback in most cases, with a few scenes exported as live Unity apps, controlled with an Xbox gamepad
        live during shows, which is still a little nerve-racking!</p>
    <p>Playback was handled using a large custom-made TouchDesigner setup, responding to OSC from Qlab, and handling
        realtime post-effects such as ripples, and mapping the two projectors onto the stage.</p>
    <p>Finally, after several years of rehearsals, covid-induced delays and fundraising, the world premiere took place
        at Worthing Pavilion Theatre in March 2022. The show plans to be touring worldwide from August 2022.</p>

        <p>Originally created for the Isle of Games 002 (see isleofgames.is) exhibition on the
                theme of &#8220;The Tempest&#8221;, the player is making their way through a pitch
                black world, with nothing but the wind to guide their path.</p>
        <p>The installation version was for two people to cooperate, one using a joystick to
                control the character, the other using rotating lava rock + button to control the
                wind. This version is just controlled using the keyboard.</p>

        <p>Created by Huldufugl (an Icelandic / British events company co-founded by myself and
                writer, actress &amp; producer Nanna Gunnars), the show explores what I&#8217;ve
                been wanting to do for a long time, smashing together future-thinking theatre forms
                with technology &#8211; in this case, Virtual Reality and mutliplayer

        <p>The concept initially began as a short play by Nanna, written and performed in a
                conventional theatre in 2016 &#8211; after which I put forward the idea to re-create
                this piece in VR. We premiered the first version in Reykjavík in August 2017, and
                developed it for a longer run in July 2018, before taking the show to the Stockholm
                Fringe Festival in September 2018, and with more international dates planned for
                2019!</p>
        One person at a time experiences the piece inside of a 2 x 2m physical space, whilst
        <p> the actor performs in a separate physical space. For our first outing, we used the
                Xsens motion capture suit (expertly handled by <a href="http://puppit.is" target="_blank">PuppIT</a>),
                but
                currently
                the show involves two Oculus Rift
                setups, sharing the same virtual space using multiplayer networking.</p>
        <p>Show control is handled by an operator, who can observe and control both events in
                the world and the &#8216;voice in your head&#8217; via a Qlab interface, and we have
                a beautiful LED box created by Swedish engineering magicians <a href="http://svartljus.se"

    <h4>Horizons is a series of interactive VR music journeys with music from Bonobo, My Panda Shall Fly, and Reuben
        Cainer</h4>
</section>
<section>
    <p>After a chance introduction in Iceland via the wonderful people at <a
            href="http://www.bedroomcommunity.net/">Bedroom Community</a>, I was invited to
        submit a proposal for a launch title for Google&#8217;s new VR headset, Daydream.
    </p>
    <p>I contacted my long-term collaborator Yuli Levtov and together with our friends David
        Li and Leif Podhajsky, we laid out plans to create the first music-focused title for
        this new platform.</p>
</section>
<section>
    <p>After launch, in collaboration with Ninja Tune heavyweight artist
        Bonobo, the Horizons team (Yuli Levtov, David Li, Leif Podhajsky and myself) saddled up again to
        create a brand new psychedelic interactive music journey for the Horizons platform
        on Google Daydream.</p>

    <p>The new scene features the track Outlier from his latest album Migration, and allows
        you to deeply interact with the music, which in turn has an effect on the landscape
        you fly through. Flocks of birds join you on your journey through sand dunes,
        towering mountains and beneath the waves.</p>

    <p>After the sad demise of the Google Daydream platform, we were approached by HTC to port the title to their range
        of devices, and it is now available on <a
            href="https://www.viveport.com/078645bd-a81e-4223-854f-b546f719d5f6">HTC Viveport</a> for HTC Vive, Focus
        and Flow</p>

    <p> In 2017, my studio Horizons (along with co-founder Yuli Levtov and David Li) were approached by Chris Milk and
        Aaron Koblin's VR powerhouse Within to help them develop an incredibly ambitious VR project in collaboration
        with Oculus Studios, and the musical / creative force of OKGO.</p>
    <p class="small">The task was to create an experience in VR where the user could produce their very own pop song,
        complete with drums, bass, guitar, synth, vocals (recorded and auto-tuned by the user!) and a special cow-based
        freestyle solo instrument.</p>
    <p class="small">The final piece includes a staggering amount of layers of animation, machine learning, audio
        analysis and processing, a custom sound engine, hand interaction and musical theory.</p>

    <p>In 2018 we were very excited to give the world a peek of the final piece, at both Tribeca Film Festival and
        Sonar+ in Barcelona.</p>
    <p>Two audience members at a time, carefully guided by white-coated docents, could collaborate on building a song
        together in a purpose-built booth. The piece attracted a significant amount of positive attention, being
        described as 'Social VR's Rock Band' by Wired, and others.</p>
    <p>My role as lead developer ranged from prototyping musical interaction concepts at the start of the project, to
        co-ordinating the fantastic development team across several different cities and time zones, overseeing the
        asset pipeline of animated creatures from the art team into Unity, and working directly on various parts of the
        project.</p>
    <p>We're excited for the final public release of the project, to see the music people make in the Menagerie of the
        Holy Cow!</p>

    <p>Unconfined is an immersive interactive installation by
        Universal Everything and Zaha Hadid Architects commissioned by Samsung Mobile and
        unveiled at Milan Design Week 2017, to accompany the launch of the new Galaxy S8
        phone.</p>

    <p>So I&#8217;ve been a massive fan of Universal Everything&#8217;s work ever since
        Matt Pyke formed the studio post-Designers Republic, so being invited to join them
        as a developer on this adventure was a bit exciting, to say the least!
    </p>
    <p>
        The brief was to produce a real-time, interactive artwork that would be projected
        onto seven monumental &#8216;petals&#8217;, designed and inhabiting a space by Zaha
        Hadid Architects, within a relatively short timeframe &#8211; and with a lot of
        press attention on the final result, so no small order.</p>

    <p>
        With a tight timeline, the lead developer Chris Mullany and I developed a system for
        simulating choreographed bird-like motion onto thousands of unique
        &#8216;avatars&#8217; &#8211; playful, generative striped characters who would fly
        and dance around the space.</p>
    <p>We worked rapidly in Unity, with Chris handling the creation and rendering of the
        Avatars, and me handling the flocking motion and choreographies that would play in
        synchronicity with composed music from Simon Pyke / Freefarm.</p>
    <p>The final setup in Milan required an impressive assortment of hardware, handled by
        an amazing crew of projectionists, d3 operators, sound and lighting designers, and
        our playback rig &#8211; 6 high-end PCs running Unity apps, all synchronised via
        network from a single server, from which we could adjust and refine all aspects of
        the show once we arrived in Milan.</p>

    The Moon Seat is a playful installation that entertains our inner child whilst
    simultaneously courting long forgotten childhood fears.

    The installation had its first public outing at the <strong>e-Luminate</strong>
    festival in Cambridge, UK from 12th-17th February 2016, and was located on the front
    lawn of the prestigious Cambridge Union Society.

    Audience members were invited to sit, at which point the pool of moonlight would
    instantly open to show their shadow. After a few seconds, their shadow would
    transform into an animal &#8211; still controlled by their bodily movements, but
    with a character all of its own. An ethereal generative soundtrack reacting to the
    users&#8217; movements accompanies the piece.

    I&#8217;d worked with Alex for a long time at B-Reel, and I was very excited to be
    asked to get involved in his first independent installation art piece!

    It quickly became apparent that we were going to need some more help, so we drafted
    in ex-B-Reelers and good friends Yi-Wen Lin and Christian Persson to come on board.

    We pulled in quite a variety of technologies for this one, including <a href="http://processing.org"
        target="_blank">Processing</a> (main show), <a href="http://nwjs.io" target="_blank">NodeWebkit</a> (gesture
    detection &#038;
    tracking), <a href="http://labs.adobe.com/technologies/flashruntimes/" target="_blank">Flash/AIR</a> (character
    animation &#038; playback) and <a href="http://puredata.info/" target="_blank">Pure Data</a> (generative audio
    &#038; DMX control), all talking together over more than 16 OSC channels.

    Get Vive Ready by HTC, Google and B-Reel was a WebGL experience that invites the user
    to test if they are &#8216;Vive&nbsp;Ready&#8217;, to promote the launch of
    HTC&#8217;s Vive VR headset.

    The site uses a mobile device as a controller for the 3D desktop experience, and
    requires you to chop, dodge, swing and shake your way through four challenging
    levels.

</section>
<section>
    Users completing all four levels were able to enter a prize draw to win an actual
    Vive headset and controller set.

    The site involves some cutting-edge WebGL and mobile phone interaction, which we
    were happy to see recognised in a number of awards including the FWA&#8217;s site of
    the Month (which followed our project Mmorph&#8217;s award the previous month!)

    <p>Sónar is an international festival of progressive music and multimedia arts,
        originally out of Barcelona, but now taking place in several locations worldwide,
        including Reykjavik since 2013.
        It is hosted in the landmark building Harpa, a beautiful structure with a unique
        interlocking cell-like front facade (designed by Olafur Eliasson) each containing an
        LED light fixture. Combined it forms a large outdoor screen that is visible across
        much of downtown Reykjavik.
    </p>

    <p>Artist Atli Bollasson and I were lucky enough to be the first outside artists to do
        something on this facade in 2014, with the publicly-playable arcade game <a
            href="http://www.owenhindley.co.uk/harpa-pong/">Harpa PONG</a> at
        Reykjavík&#8217;s Culture night.
        After the success of PONG, Harpa and the Sónar organisers invited Atli and myself to
        do a repeat installation on the lights of Harpa for the festival in 2015, and again
        in 2016.</p>

    <p>We knew we wanted to do a bit more than simply re-run PONG, so instead we decided
        &#8211; in addition to running the game &#8211; we would turn the entire building
        into an audio-reactive light show, taking the music being played inside and use it
        to drive the visuals outside.</p>

    <p>To do this we reached out to other creative developers, providing them with a code
        framework, brief, and challenge to do something amazing with only 36 x 11 pixels. We
        ended up with over 12 functioning visual responses from 8 developers from around
        Europe, which was way beyond our expectations.</p>

    <!-- The results can be seen in the video above, for three days the visuals were bouncing around to the likes of Skrillex, Todd Terje and Elliphant, and were attracting attention not only in the city of Reykjavik, but also (we happily realised) inside the venue as well, where we accidentally became the main lightshow for the SonarPub stage. -->

    mmorph is an adventure into new ways of delivering interactive music in the browser
    and beyond.

    A collaboration between global music agency MassiveMusic, Reactify Music, Grotesk,
    Enzien Audio and myself, mmorph is an example of a new workflow which we hope will
    open up many possibilities for interactive audio &#8211; first in the browser, and
    then for games, apps, installations and VR.
    The site takes you through an interactive music piece, enabling different musical
    parts, applying realtime effects, composing and looping a top-line synth, and
    creating intense build-ups and drops!

    My role was lead developer on the project, handling the integration of the audio
    code from Reactify &#038; Enzien Audio (who in turn were working with original music
    composed by Massive) with realtime SVG graphics and animations art-directed by
    Grotesk.

    The interactive audio was produced via a unique workflow where Reactify worked
    rapidly and closely with Massive&#8217;s in-house composer in Pure Data, an visual
    programming environment that allows for real-time prototyping and development.

    This Pure Data &#8216;patch&#8217; was then converted to run in the browser via
    Enzien Audio&#8217;s <strong>Heavy</strong> compiler. This compiler can also
    transform the same source patch into code suitable for Unity, Unreal engine,
    OpenFrameworks, desktop/mobile apps and VR experiences, with little or no
    alterations to the original.

        For a few days in February 2016, visitors of Harpa Music Hall in Reykjavík were
        invited to play the façade of the building as they would an instrument. A
        &#8220;light organ&#8221; was placed on the 4th floor balcony, with a stunning view
        of the inside of the geometrical glass front and the downtown
        area.Anyone who passed through could learn how to play in blue or red or
        green, with quick flashes or swelling pads of light, and impress the whole city with
        an optical performance.

    Resonate is a festival that brings together artists to drive a forward-looking
    debate on the position of technology in art and culture.
    Held annually in Belgrade, Serbia, it draws visual artists, programmers, performers,
    musicians and curators to present and discuss their work, share new ideas, work and
    party hard.
    <!-- The graphic identity for the 2015 festival was developed by the Resonate team and FIELD.io, and is described as NEON TRIBAL PLAYGROUND CULTURE - and it informed the direction for all graphic, web and motion design relating to the festival.-->

    For the trailer, FIELD collaborated with director / designer Antar Walker to bring
    their graphic identity for the festival into motion.
</section>
<section>
    I was approached by FIELD to collaborate with the team on the musical score and
    sound design for the piece.
    <!-- The brief was to produce something as playful, human, optimistic but still contemporary as the identity itself, incorporating tribal sounds and percussion whilst still retaining an air of exploration and ambition.-->

    I immediately brought my long-suffering friend and collaborator Ragnar Hrafnkelsson
    on board, and together we composed, mixed and mastered the final soundtrack.

    In addition to receiving considerable coverage online, the trailer was also aired on
    Serbian national TV in the run-up to the festival opening.

    International agency Isobar collaborated with B-Reel and Groovy Gecko to create a
    live, web-connected experience that allowed users to smash a real-life piñata using
    a robotic arm, in order to promote the new flavours of Pringles
    Tortillas.
    Users in the UK and Germany were able to sign up via Twitter and/or Facebook to take
    a hit at the unlucky piñata, successful entrants would win a Tortillas-related
    prize!
</section>

<section>
    B-Reel approached me to lead the design and build of the robotic arm &#8211; a
    really fun challenge!
    This required a lot of research into fabrication methods, and learning about
    pneumatics for the first time, combined with electronic control (via <a href="http://www.phidgets.com/"
        target="_blank">Phidgets</a>) and backend
    development to connect the entire system to the website (being developed by
    Isobar)
    After constructing two beautiful robots (Pedro &#038; Mario, in reserve), we to work
    smashing piñatas, the arm pounding each one with 20psi of force per hit. Over 40
    piñatas a day were obliterated live online, in a custom-built Mexican marketplace
    set deep within East London.

    Spectra 2, a mesmerising kinetic sculpture by FIELD.io in collaboration with design
    studio Accept &#038; Proceed was displayed in the studio&#8217;s East London gallery
    space in Summer 2014.
    The piece consists of suspended polished steel segments, controlled by stepper
    motors &#038; custom electronics, that form rippling terrains inspired by NASA lunar
    meteor impact data.

    Collaborating with lead engineer Laurence Symonds, FIELD and A&#038;P, I was
    responsible for the design &#038; implementation of the motor software control
    system, which played back a pre-choreographed sequence (pre-visualised and designed
    in Houdini by FIELD).
    I was also very happy to be part of the superhuman build, test &#038;
    installation team.

    Custom Arduino firmware and a unique serial protocol needed to be developed in order
    to synchronise movement across all 48 motors for the duration of the hour-plus long
    sequence. A Node.js server was written to handle playback and synchronisation with a
    wall-mounted display, and triggering of audio samples via OSC.

    PONG is a massive interactive outdoor artwork that allows two people to play the
    classic game against each other on the monumental facade of Harpa, Iceland&#8217;s
    flagship concert hall in downtown Reykjavik, designed by Ólafur Eliasson.

    Conceived and produced by Atli Bollason, the project began as a chance meeting
    between myself and Atli at a birthday party in Reykjavik, and over the next few
    months developed into a reality &#8211; with not only the CEO of the building coming
    on board very quickly, but for the first time for a project like this, Ólafur
    himself (the first time he has allowed a project like this to take over the
    facade&#8217;s lighting system). Vodafone Iceland also agreed to sponsor the
    project, and supply us with some of the equipment.

    The project was launched on Menningarnótt (Culture Night) on the 23rd August 2014,
    and ran for a week afterwards as part of the Reykjavik Dance Festival.
    For the launch night, we setup a stage in front of the building, and players used a
    pair of phones to control their &#8216;paddles&#8217; on the 43m-high screen.
    Afterwards, players were able to join a special Wi-fi network which took them
    directly to the game, which was transmitted from a hill overlooking the building.
    This would allow them to join a virtual queue, and play against friends or complete
    strangers.
</section>
<section>
    Our roles were split with Atli handling the concept, creative direction, project
    management and publicity, and me handling the design, hardware, networking and
    programming.

    Three separate Node.js servers run together to create the experience; one running in
    the basement of Harpa which outputs DMX to control the 35&#215;11 pixel display (6
    universes of 512 channels each), one running in the cloud which actually simulates
    the game physics, and receives WebSocket connections from the player&#8217;s phone,
    and another which handles the game queue.

    An HTML5 mobile front-end was also developed to give visual feedback to the player
    of their paddle, and current score.

    The code for the entire project is available on github.

    &#8216;The Glitch&#8217; was a highly secretive and unusual campaign launched by
    Microsoft, CP+B and B-Reel that took players on a journey across the Internet,
    challenging them to solve puzzles and crack codes to win a mysterious
    prize.
    This formed part of the UK XBox One launch, and part of Microsoft&#8217;s effort to
    engage directly with hardcore gamers by working on their level.
    The glitch took the form of a 1 second &#8216;disruption&#8217; to the Xbox TV
    collaboration that had already been on regular rotation on UK TV channels for some
    time. Hidden within this were a number of codes and clues that would set players off
    on their journey.

    I headed up the development side of the project team at B-Reel, and was responsible
    for laying out this network of cryptic sites across the web in such a way as to give
    no clue as to who, or what was behind the Glitch.
    A sophisticated PHP backend system was built to monitor and control all the various
    endpoints to allow tracking of players as they moved through the contest, and
    shutting off routes as soon as prizes had been awarded.
    In addition, I was also responsible for the glitched-up sound design across all of
    the routes, which added to the air of mystery and suspense surrounding the
    campaign.

    City of Drones is an interactive digital environment developed by musician John
    Cale, speculative architect Liam Young and digital artists FIELD. Charting the story
    of a lost drone drifting through an abstract cityscape, players are invited to pilot
    a virtual craft and remotely explore this imaginary world. Samples from Cale’s
    original soundscape compositions echo across the landscape as we see the city
    through the eyes of the drone, buzzing between the buildings, drifting endlessly, in
    an ambient audio visual choreography.
    City of Drones lives online, and as an installation at the Barbican Center, London,
    as part of the Digital Revolution exhibition.

    I was brought on to the project to develop the dynamic audio of the piece with the
    team at FIELD. This involved remixing original material from John Cale, including
    bespoke work from BXFTYS, and setting it all in a constantly changing, immersive 3D
    sonic landscape.

    Spot sound effects are triggered by different locations within the environment, and
    the sounds of drones as they fly past are processed using the WebAudio HRTF panner
    to accurately position the sounds in 3D space.

    The background music layer and ambience also change as you fly through the different
    areas.

    In addition, I also contributed to the physics of the drones, giving them some
    freedom of movement as they fly around the space, avoiding buildings and each other,
    plus I developed the on-screen HUD graphics and animation.
