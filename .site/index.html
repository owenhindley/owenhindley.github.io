    <p>This short film in VR is an spin-off project from Huldufugl and Hikapee's (equally ambitious) stage show, The
        Hidden People, after that project was delayed by a year due to the pandemic.</p>
    <p>We've been collaborating with UK aerial circus company Hikapee since 2018 on a large-scale stage production - but
        when it became apparent that we were going to have to pause work on it for at least a year, we came up with the
        idea of producing an animated VR short film using the same performers, set in the same world, but with a brand
        new storyline.</p>
    <p>The first step was to find a motion capture company brave enough to work with tumbling, spinning circus
        performers using silks, trapeze and counterbalancing equipment - a real challenge for the tracking system - and
        then do the entire thing on location, whilst adhering to strict COVID-19 safety measures.</p>
    <p>We were extremely lucky to find a partner in Target3D, who sent an incredible crew to join our artists in
        isolation at 101 Outdoor Arts in Newbury for a week. Under Bryony from Hikapee's direction, they recorded an
        entire narrative of aerial circus-infused action.</p>
</section>
<section>
    <p>The film is currently under production with all the virtual sets, characters, lighting and composition currently
        under way.</p>
    <p>It's a unique challenge to produce animated work for VR - where almost anything is possible in terms of angles,
        lighting, sound and set design. For our piece, we're taking a lot of cues from theatre over film in terms of set
        layout and the audience's relationship to the performers - but this still leaves us a huge possibility space to
        play with, which is extremely exciting!</p>
    <p>We're also aiming for a unique art style that represents the Icelandic nature - acheived through procedural
        modelling in Houdini, taking the rough outlines of landscapes, and 'shredding' them into thousands of small,
        individually coloured polygons. This approach retains sharp edges in VR even up-close, without using textures,
        whilst also giving us fine control over colour, pre-baked static lighting, and vertex shader effects like wind
        movement in trees, water and moss.</p>
    <p>Release is scheduled for early 2022, for Oculus Quest and other major VR platforms.</p>

    <p>One day, you wake up and find yourself trapped in a transparent box in a hostile, barren landscape. It appears
        that you're not alone. There is the Caretaker, who says they just want to keep you safe inside this box,
        promising to show you wonders beyond imagining. There are the Others, individuals trapped in boxes just as you
        are - some of whom are acting strangely. And the Voice in your head - together all of them are talking, acting,
        behaving at odds with one another - so who will you believe?

    <p> In 2017, my studio Horizons (along with co-founder Yuli Levtov and David Li) were approached by Chris Milk and
        Aaron Koblin's VR powerhouse Within to help them develop an incredibly ambitious VR project in collaboration
        with Oculus Studios, and the musical / creative force of OKGO.</p>
    <p class="small">The task was to create an experience in VR where the user could produce their very own pop song,
        complete with drums, bass, guitar, synth, vocals (recorded and auto-tuned by the user!) and a special cow-based
        freestyle solo instrument.</p>
    <p class="small">The final piece includes a staggering amount of layers of animation, machine learning, audio
        analysis and processing, a custom sound engine, hand interaction and musical theory.</p>

    <p>In 2018 we were very excited to give the world a peek of the final piece, at both Tribeca Film Festival and
        Sonar+ in Barcelona.</p>
    <p>Two audience members at a time, carefully guided by white-coated docents, could collaborate on building a song
        together in a purpose-built booth. The piece attracted a significant amount of positive attention, being
        described as 'Social VR's Rock Band' by Wired, and others.</p>
    <p>My role as lead developer ranged from prototyping musical interaction concepts at the start of the project, to
        co-ordinating the fantastic development team across several different cities and time zones, overseeing the
        asset pipeline of animated creatures from the art team into Unity, and working directly on various parts of the
        project.</p>
    <p>We're excited for the final public release of the project, to see the music people make in the Menagerie of the
        Holy Cow!</p>

    <p>During my time with Volta, we were thrilled to collaborate with world-renowned musician and innovator Imogen Heap
        to create the official video for her single Last Night Of An Empire.</p>

    <p>Volta had at that point been developing its AR capabilities, particularly by integrating Keijiro Takahashi's
        Rcam2 library, which allowed us to easily integrate a real camera feed from a LIDAR-equipped iPad with 3D
        objects and visuals generated in Unity, and be able to freely move the camera around the space.</p>

    <p>True to her experimental and open spirit, Imogen decided that the recording of the video would also be
        live-streamed, meaning everything from the camera movment to AR visual effects and Imogen's choreography were
        repeated and refined over and over again and streamed to Youtube, whilst we searched for the perfect take.</p>

    <p>Imogen's loyal legion of Heapsters provided encouragement and comment via the stream, and after just over three
        hours, the final take was in the bag. But it didn't end there - we also produced a standalone VR-only version of
        the video to be included as an archived performance inside of Volta.</p>

</section>
<section>
    <p>Ahead of the recording at Imogen's barn studio space in Essex, I got to work creating visual elements in Houdini
        + Unity, and exposing parameters for on-set creative technologist Alexis Michallek to hook up to the Ableton
        session running the show so he could choreograph the AR visuals in time with the playback.</p>

    <p>For the VR version, along with several new visual effects, I built several extensions to the Unity Timeline
        system to allow me to work quickly with the existing Volta setup and create a tightly synced experience
        (separate to the livestreamed video).</p>

    <p>The VR video is unfortunately only available inside Volta VR, but you can catch a 2D recording of it <strong><a

    <p>A collaboration between Hikapee Theatre and Huldufugl, The Hidden People is a show for medium to large stages
        (500 capacity+) that combines Icelandic folklore, circus/ aerial arts, performance and creative technology.</p>
    <p>Our story concerns the Hidden People, beings of uncertain benevolence often held responsible in Icelandic stories
        for both sudden good fortune and disappearances, unexpected occurrences and madness.</p>
    <p>We are using these tales to present modern environmental issues, specifically the building of hydroelectric dams
        in Iceland.</p>
</section>
<section>
    <p>Hikapee approached us at Huldufugl to collaborate on this piece, and for us to join our skills with creative
        technology to their high-flying aerial storytelling abilities.</p>
    <p>During the research and development process, we experimented with different technologies to animate this world -
        and settled on large-scale projection mapping, using both the set and the performers themselves as a canvas</p>
    <p>We ended up having projected visuals for the entire duration of the show (90 minutes). I used Houdini and Unity
        to model and render the scenes, working in realtime during rehearsals, then rendering out high-resolution HAP
        video for playback in most cases, with a few scenes exported as live Unity apps, controlled with an Xbox gamepad
        live during shows, which is still a little nerve-racking!</p>
    <p>Playback was handled using a large custom-made TouchDesigner setup, responding to OSC from Qlab, and handling
        realtime post-effects such as ripples, and mapping the two projectors onto the stage.</p>
    <p>Finally, after several years of rehearsals, covid-induced delays and fundraising, the world premiere took place
        at Worthing Pavilion Theatre in March 2022. The show plans to be touring worldwide from August 2022.</p>

<section>
    <p>Out Of Sync is a mad idea, an experimental performance formed in response to the
        COVID-19 pandemic. So obviously in 2020 many artists across the world are unable to
        perform to audiences of more than a handful of people (at best), and those countries
        where audiences <em>can</em> gather in numbers have achieved this largely through
        (sensibly) strict border restrictions, meaning they are unable to invite
        international artists to come and play. In addition to this, the global climate
        crisis remains &#8211; albeit backgrounded a bit by the pandemic.
    </p>
    <p>The idea is that a performer in Iceland (at the time gatherings were limited to 10
        people or fewer) would live-stream to a club in Taipei, Taiwan. There, a full
        audience of dancing people (Taiwan had no gathering restrictions at the time) would
        enjoy the party. However, we had two dancers, or &#8220;eyes&#8221; inside the club,
        using mobile phones to provide a two-way video stream <em>back</em> to Reykjavik,
        where two people at a time would experience the party on the other side of the world
        inside large wooden booths specially built for the purpose.</p>

    <p>Now a 90 minute performance, regardless of how great the music is or colourful his
        onesie is, might not be the most visually interesting experience if it was
        a simple camera setup. Luckily, I had been working for several months with my
        long-suffering collaborator Yuli Levtov on an exciting new project called Volta,
        which aims to make it easy for performing artists to create visually engaging
        livestream experiences, either for 2d video streaming or in VR.</p>
    <p>Even more luckily, the month before, we had integrated Keijiro Takahashi&#8217;s
        outstanding Rcam2 system into Volta&#8217;s existing visual system, allowing us to
        do a full AR performance using only an iPad Pro and a laptop running Unity + Touch
        Designer.</p>
    <p>We're super happy with the results, which you can watch above, and excited to
        see where this new medium can take us. Since then we&#8217;ve incorporated a
        user-facing editor into the Volta product, which you can read more about below. In
        addition, this same team has applied to produce several more events during 2021 to
        investigate alternate means of performance and audience experience &#8211; both as
        the world recovers from the pandemic, and as we look forwards to ways to reduce the
        burden of extensive travel on artists wanting to perform outside of their home
        countries, whilst still making it a party!</p>

    <p><em>Imagine one day, you wake up inside an invisible box, unable to escape. Kassinn
            is an engaging, but playful, interactive theatre performance with a live actor
            in virtual reality. Will you trust this mysterious stranger? Or listen to the
            voice in your head, trying to get you out?</em></p>
    <p>Created by Huldufugl (an Icelandic / British events company co-founded by myself and
        writer, actress &amp; producer Nanna Gunnars), the show explores what I&#8217;ve
        been wanting to do for a long time, smashing together future-thinking theatre forms
        with technology &#8211; in this case, Virtual Reality and mutliplayer
        gaming!</p>

    The concept initially began as a short play by Nanna, written and performed in a
    conventional theatre in 2016 &#8211; after which I put forward the idea to re-create
    this piece in VR. We premiered the first version in Reykjavík in August 2017, and
    developed it for a longer run in July 2018, before taking the show to the Stockholm
    Fringe Festival in September 2018, and with more international dates planned for
    2019!
    One person at a time experiences the piece inside of a 2 x 2m physical space, whilst
    the actor performs in a separate physical space. For our first outing, we used the
    Xsens motion capture suit (expertly handled by <a href="http://puppit.is" target="_blank">PuppIT</a>), but currently
    the show involves two Oculus Rift
    setups, sharing the same virtual space using multiplayer networking.
    Show control is handled by an operator, who can observe and control both events in
    the world and the &#8216;voice in your head&#8217; via a Qlab interface, and we have
    a beautiful LED box created by Swedish engineering magicians <a href="http://svartljus.se"

        A short platform experience about using the wind to guide your way.
        Originally created for the Isle of Games 002 (see isleofgames.is) exhibition on the
        theme of &#8220;The Tempest&#8221;, the player is making their way through a pitch
        black world, with nothing but the wind to guide their path.
        The installation version was for two people to cooperate, one using a joystick to
        control the character, the other using rotating lava rock + button to control the
        wind. This version is just controlled using the keyboard.

    <p>Unconfined is an immersive interactive installation by
        Universal Everything and Zaha Hadid Architects commissioned by Samsung Mobile and
        unveiled at Milan Design Week 2017, to accompany the launch of the new Galaxy S8
        phone.</p>

    <p>So I&#8217;ve been a massive fan of Universal Everything&#8217;s work ever since
        Matt Pyke formed the studio post-Designers Republic, so being invited to join them
        as a developer on this adventure was a bit exciting, to say the least!
    </p>
    <p>
        The brief was to produce a real-time, interactive artwork that would be projected
        onto seven monumental &#8216;petals&#8217;, designed and inhabiting a space by Zaha
        Hadid Architects, within a relatively short timeframe &#8211; and with a lot of
        press attention on the final result, so no small order.</p>

        With a tight timeline, the lead developer Chris Mullany and I developed a system for
        simulating choreographed bird-like motion onto thousands of unique
        &#8216;avatars&#8217; &#8211; playful, generative striped characters who would fly
        and dance around the space.</p>
    <p>We worked rapidly in Unity, with Chris handling the creation and rendering of the
        Avatars, and me handling the flocking motion and choreographies that would play in
        synchronicity with composed music from Simon Pyke / Freefarm.</p>
    <p>The final setup in Milan required an impressive assortment of hardware, handled by
        an amazing crew of projectionists, d3 operators, sound and lighting designers, and
        our playback rig &#8211; 6 high-end PCs running Unity apps, all synchronised via
        network from a single server, from which we could adjust and refine all aspects of
        the show once we arrived in Milan.</p>

    Horizons is a series of interactive VR music journeys for
    Google Daydream, available for free on the Play Store.

    After a chance introduction in Iceland via the wonderful people at <a
        href="http://www.bedroomcommunity.net/">Bedroom Community</a>, I was invited to
    submit a proposal for a launch title for Google&#8217;s new VR headset, Daydream. I
    contacted my long-term collaborator Yuli Levtov and together with our friends David
    Li and Leif Podhajsky, we laid out plans to create the first music-focused title for
    this new platform.
</section>
<section>
    After launch, in collaboration with Ninja Tune heavyweight artist
    Bonobo, the Horizons team (Yuli Levtov, David Li, Leif Podhajsky and myself) saddled up again to
    create a brand new psychedelic interactive music journey for the Horizons platform
    on Google Daydream.

    The new scene features the track Outlier from his latest album Migration, and allows
    you to deeply interact with the music, which in turn has an effect on the landscape
    you fly through. Flocks of birds join you on your journey through sand dunes,
    towering mountains and beneath the waves.

<section>Within the app, you control the music &#8211; the music
    controls the world. You can use the Daydream controller to make an otherworldly
    jungle come alive with sound, or travel at breakneck speed through colourful
    hyperspace.


    In December 2016 we launched the first two scenes, featuring great music from both
    My Panda Shall Fly and Reuben Cainer. We&#8217;re very excited to be launching the
    third scene in early 2017, and there&#8217;s more to come.

        For a few days in February 2016, visitors of Harpa Music Hall in Reykjavík were
        invited to play the façade of the building as they would an instrument. A
        &#8220;light organ&#8221; was placed on the 4th floor balcony, with a stunning view
        of the inside of the geometrical glass front and the downtown
        area.Anyone who passed through could learn how to play in blue or red or
        green, with quick flashes or swelling pads of light, and impress the whole city with
        an optical performance.

    The Moon Seat is a playful installation that entertains our inner child whilst
    simultaneously courting long forgotten childhood fears.

    The installation had its first public outing at the <strong>e-Luminate</strong>
    festival in Cambridge, UK from 12th-17th February 2016, and was located on the front
    lawn of the prestigious Cambridge Union Society.

    Audience members were invited to sit, at which point the pool of moonlight would
    instantly open to show their shadow. After a few seconds, their shadow would
    transform into an animal &#8211; still controlled by their bodily movements, but
    with a character all of its own. An ethereal generative soundtrack reacting to the
    users&#8217; movements accompanies the piece.

    I&#8217;d worked with Alex for a long time at B-Reel, and I was very excited to be
    asked to get involved in his first independent installation art piece!

    It quickly became apparent that we were going to need some more help, so we drafted
    in ex-B-Reelers and good friends Yi-Wen Lin and Christian Persson to come on board.

    We pulled in quite a variety of technologies for this one, including <a href="http://processing.org"
        target="_blank">Processing</a> (main show), <a href="http://nwjs.io" target="_blank">NodeWebkit</a> (gesture
    detection &#038;
    tracking), <a href="http://labs.adobe.com/technologies/flashruntimes/" target="_blank">Flash/AIR</a> (character
    animation &#038; playback) and <a href="http://puredata.info/" target="_blank">Pure Data</a> (generative audio
    &#038; DMX control), all talking together over more than 16 OSC channels.

    mmorph is an adventure into new ways of delivering interactive music in the browser
    and beyond.

    A collaboration between global music agency MassiveMusic, Reactify Music, Grotesk,
    Enzien Audio and myself, mmorph is an example of a new workflow which we hope will
    open up many possibilities for interactive audio &#8211; first in the browser, and
    then for games, apps, installations and VR.
    The site takes you through an interactive music piece, enabling different musical
    parts, applying realtime effects, composing and looping a top-line synth, and
    creating intense build-ups and drops!

    My role was lead developer on the project, handling the integration of the audio
    code from Reactify &#038; Enzien Audio (who in turn were working with original music
    composed by Massive) with realtime SVG graphics and animations art-directed by
    Grotesk.

    The interactive audio was produced via a unique workflow where Reactify worked
    rapidly and closely with Massive&#8217;s in-house composer in Pure Data, an visual
    programming environment that allows for real-time prototyping and development.

    This Pure Data &#8216;patch&#8217; was then converted to run in the browser via
    Enzien Audio&#8217;s <strong>Heavy</strong> compiler. This compiler can also
    transform the same source patch into code suitable for Unity, Unreal engine,
    OpenFrameworks, desktop/mobile apps and VR experiences, with little or no
    alterations to the original.

    Get Vive Ready by HTC, Google and B-Reel was a WebGL experience that invites the user
    to test if they are &#8216;Vive&nbsp;Ready&#8217;, to promote the launch of
    HTC&#8217;s Vive VR headset.

    The site uses a mobile device as a controller for the 3D desktop experience, and
    requires you to chop, dodge, swing and shake your way through four challenging
    levels.

</section>
<section>
    Users completing all four levels were able to enter a prize draw to win an actual
    Vive headset and controller set.

    The site involves some cutting-edge WebGL and mobile phone interaction, which we
    were happy to see recognised in a number of awards including the FWA&#8217;s site of
    the Month (which followed our project Mmorph&#8217;s award the previous month!)

    <p>Sónar is an international festival of progressive music and multimedia arts,
        originally out of Barcelona, but now taking place in several locations worldwide,
        including Reykjavik since 2013.
        It is hosted in the landmark building Harpa, a beautiful structure with a unique
        interlocking cell-like front facade (designed by Olafur Eliasson) each containing an
        LED light fixture. Combined it forms a large outdoor screen that is visible across
        much of downtown Reykjavik.
    </p>

    <p>Artist Atli Bollasson and I were lucky enough to be the first outside artists to do
        something on this facade in 2014, with the publicly-playable arcade game <a
            href="http://www.owenhindley.co.uk/harpa-pong/">Harpa PONG</a> at
        Reykjavík&#8217;s Culture night.
        After the success of PONG, Harpa and the Sónar organisers invited Atli and myself to
        do a repeat installation on the lights of Harpa for the festival in 2015, and again
        in 2016.</p>

    <p>We knew we wanted to do a bit more than simply re-run PONG, so instead we decided
        &#8211; in addition to running the game &#8211; we would turn the entire building
        into an audio-reactive light show, taking the music being played inside and use it
        to drive the visuals outside.</p>

    <p>To do this we reached out to other creative developers, providing them with a code
        framework, brief, and challenge to do something amazing with only 36 x 11 pixels. We
        ended up with over 12 functioning visual responses from 8 developers from around
        Europe, which was way beyond our expectations.</p>

    <!-- The results can be seen in the video above, for three days the visuals were bouncing around to the likes of Skrillex, Todd Terje and Elliphant, and were attracting attention not only in the city of Reykjavik, but also (we happily realised) inside the venue as well, where we accidentally became the main lightshow for the SonarPub stage. -->
